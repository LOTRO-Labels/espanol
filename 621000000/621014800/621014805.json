The bag was rent, and the sweets fell from it as she flew.\\n\\n'She realized her mistake only as the last sweet fell, and with her keen eyes watched as wintry beasts seized it and ran off into the snow. She had flown among the cold and snowy regions of Middle-earth, she told us, to avoid the sun's great heat and to keep the sweets from spoiling.\\n\\n'It is much to ask, I know, but those sweets were destined for the poor children of Winter-home. Will you visit the frozen regions of Middle-earth and recover them? I fear they may all have been seized by the creatures of those parts. The sweets that were lost, you should know, were hot cross buns, plum pudding, gingerbread, peppermint treats, a flask of wassail, and fruit cake.'",
