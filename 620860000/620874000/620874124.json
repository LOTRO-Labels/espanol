      "en": "Fifteenth of September\\nI feel renewed when I don the necklace. I can't explain it, but it is as if its mere touch brings fresh strength coursing through my veins. I feel like I can do anything while I'm wearing it.\\n\\nTwenty-first of September\\nI have removed the necklace for now. I fear it was beginning to affect my judgement. Last week I flew into a rage when Rubej told me he'd heard talk in town of putting together a search party to track us down. I hurled him against the wall and nearly broke his back. The bauble, it seems, fuels my anger as well as giving me strength. Even so, I cannot bring myself to get rid of it. It is too dear to me.\\n\\nThird of October\\nI fear the gang is growing leery of me. The search party has been afield for more than a week, and we've been lying low in the caverns. All this time in close quarters has told upon us all. Yesterday I caught Khedem in my quarters, rummaging through my things. I bloodied his nose to teach him his place. I don't think he saw the necklace, but it was a near thing. I don't know what I would have done if he took it â€¦\\n\\nSeventeenth of October\\nThe lads are plotting to take the necklace. I am sure of it. I heard Tunon and Bughed whispering to each other, then they got quiet when I walked by. The lot of them eye me when they think I'm not looking. I am sure of it. I must protect it. I will defend it however I can. I should start wearing it again, to keep it safe.",
