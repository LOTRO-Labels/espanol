I need a herb named lomthond, or wearywort to the shepherds, which can be found near to the Falls of Rauros and has properties that can ease the pain and grant me some vigour. I must eat, too. Of all the things in this place, the meat of the small lizards found about is most edible. And even with these in my stomach, bolstering my strength, I think I shall need a good stick to lean on. Perhaps there is one lying under one of these trees.'",
