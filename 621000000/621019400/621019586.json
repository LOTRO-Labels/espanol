Many are lost to the ferocity of the wargs, their sharp teeth and their biting jaws, but several others are... caged? I am puzzled, [placeholder]. Who built these cages? Do the wargs work with some allies, cage-builders that work in tandem with them to save their prey for later? These are patient wargs indeed, if that be so, and if not, does that mean they built the cages themselves? And how could this be done?\\n\\n'It matters not, though the question bothers me tremendously! I will put it from my mind, and ask that you destroy the cages and save the captive animals, no matter who built the cages that confine them. But I cannot banish the thought of the wargs pulling twine with their teeth and assembling wooden poles and boards for the cage-walls, and it quite upsets me! Bah!'",
