Evendim abounds with tales of old treasure, most of them completely false. But this scroll... this is an account of a man -- an adventurer shall we say, to be polite to the dead -- who scavenged the Fields of Fornost long ago, after the Witch-king's great defeat. It seems this fellow hid his finds not far away.\\n\\n'From your point of view, this treasure is a legitimate trove -- there should be no reason that anyone could not honourably recover it if they happened to find its location. If you wish to find this trove, according to the scroll, it lies hidden beneath a stone marker in Barad Rath, ruins that lie to the north-east of here.'",
