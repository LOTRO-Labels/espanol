I can tell by the look on your face that you know the gate of which I speak! Yes, I entered Torech Ungol itself! Barely made it out alive, but I slew a great many spiders while I could! I then found my way to that cursed forest, Taurlingol. Easier pickings, until that big one chanced upon me and my leg, thinking to have us both for dinner. Heh!\\n\\n'I will stay here for now. The Rangers are gracious enough hosts. Get out there with Legolas and slay some more spiders for me! As for the tower, hmm, I think the spiders have surely overtaken it by now.
