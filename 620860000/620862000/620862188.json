On one hand, we have the emissaries of Saruman the White, who demand our fealty in battles to come, while the Duvodiad of the North once again tresspass unwanted upon our lands.\\n\\n'Glynn Brenin will soon hold council to decide our course. We have no love for the Men of the North, but we are not blind...we see what is happening to our brethren in Dunland. They will serve Isengard as pawns in the war to come, and many will never see their homes again. Yet if we refuse, we may come to blows with our own kinsmen, or the savage half-orcs who serve under the banner of the White Hand. I cannot say which would be worse.\\n\\n'Know that Glynn Brenin's mind is not yet resolved in this matter, Duvodiad. Prove your worth to the brehur, and he may yet find the will to reject the entreaties of Isengard. Otherwise, I suspect that your wandering friends will soon be hunted down by Saruman's armies, and our Men-folk shall march to war in the South, to what fate, I know not.'",
