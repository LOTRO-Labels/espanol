The dwarves that went on the expedition never returned, so whatever information they may have gleaned has been lost to the drifts of snow.\\n\\n'I beseech you; could you follow in their footsteps and see if you can recover any of their belongings now frozen in ice? Any information may prove useful to our efforts. Just beware of the freezing cold out there.'",
