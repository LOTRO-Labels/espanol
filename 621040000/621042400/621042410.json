From that day, Urro's hand has hung from Frerin's belt, and my master has not lost a battle since.'\\n\\nThromur looks around again nervously, then continues in a whisper.\\n\\n'This morn while I was tending Frerin's armour, I noticed that the hand was gone! My master goes to war today without the luck of that grisly trophy! Please, Hermáth, look into this matter in my stead? If I were to do so, it would draw attention and the others may believe Frerin has lost his luck. The morale of the entire army is at stake! Start with Strázhek. He was on watch last night and may have seen something.'",
