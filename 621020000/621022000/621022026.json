They were the Oath-stones, and they were set upon the borders of the kingdoms we founded, three in Arnor and four in Gondor, to make peace with the tribes that lived nearby.\\n\\n'These were the Oath-stones of Arnor: Helcessar of Forochel, pale blue. Tauressar of Rhudaur, pale green. Ambossar of Cardolan, red-brown.\\n\\n'These were the Oath-stones of Gondor: Landassar of Rhovanion, golden brown. Orossar of Erech, deep black. Airessar of Harad, clear crystal. Naldassar of Rhûn, white-silver.\\n\\n'There was a power in them, but it was Sauron's malice that turned vows sworn upon an Oath-stone into bonds of enslavement. He searched for the Vandassari, attempting to weaken our alliances and subvert them for his own ends. He found Airessar, the crystal Oath-stone my brother Anárion set atop the lighthouse of Calatirion at the harbour of Vëalondë, and with his dark arts he used it to compel the service of the Haradrim.\\n\\n'While we worked to assemble the Great Alliance, it was the Bright Company that journeyed to Umbar and broke Sauron's control over Airessar and the enslaved Haradrim. This ensured the Great Alliance need not contend with an army from the south when it reached Dagorlad, which might have proven insurmountable.'",
