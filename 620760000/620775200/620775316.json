Like Elves, Dragons have never been numerous, and their savage demeanor means that few of their offspring ever reach adulthood. Their numbers have also dwindled in Middle-earth -- but recently many of the lesser drakes have been unleashed from Angmar, which is worrisome indeed, for if these lesser beasts have reappeared, can the Dragons be far behind? Regardless of the danger, these creatures must be destroyed!",

Luckily, that takes several hundred years, but with so many of them freed from the pens of Angmar, you have a great deal of work ahead of you.",
