All Thrór's court wept at the tidings, and tore their beards, then looked to Thráin who sat down heavily upon his father's throne and was silent.\\n\\n'Breaking the silence, Thorin said, \\qYou are King now, Father. What is your will? How shall we answer this outrage?\\q\\n\\n'All around the court, hands went to sword-hilt and axe-handle, and brows lowered darkly. But still Thráin sat quiet, and did not move. Seven days he remained thus, still as a stone, saying no word. Then, as a storm long gathering that breaks upon the mountainside, he arose, eyes ablaze, and cried: \\qThis cannot be borne!\\q\\n\\n'From Thráin's yearning for vengeance arose the Sixth War of Dwarves and Orcs, called simply the War of the Dwarves and Orcs in our memory. Ah, but that is another tale!'",
