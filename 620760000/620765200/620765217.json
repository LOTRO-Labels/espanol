While the Shield-maidens of Rohan were rarely called to war, they were nevertheless as well-trained and versed in the arts of battle as their male counterparts. This book tells the tale of one such Maiden caught in unexpected battle, who in striving to defend her Lord against a great onslaught, sang out in clearest tones a stirring song of war as she fought. Such was the power of her voice that even the Orcs whom she faced saw her not as a frail woman, but as a great warrior to be feared.\\n\\nAlas, you have no idea how the story ends and several other details beside seem to be missing from this copy of the book, which has been damaged by time and neglect. Perhaps there is someone at Rivendell who would be able to make use of it.",

Why yes, indeed, that's one of the books that Master Elrond himself suggested to me, though I'm afraid his own copy went missing or was loaned out who-knows how many years ago. He's got so many books around here it's beyond me how he keeps track of them at all. Anyways, Master Elrond says that there aren't supposed to be many written copies of it, as the Horse-lords prefer to hand their tales down through their story-tellers and such.\\n\\n'Oh dear, it does seem that this one is rather the worse for wear, doesn't it? What good is a tale like this without an ending -- or several bits of the beginning and middle as well, if you want to know the truth.\\n\\n'Well, I still have a great deal to study before we leave, and Elrond is a bit strict about my time, so I shan't waste it trying to piece this one together. On the other hand, if you could find those missing pages, I rather expect it'd be worth your time. Elrond hinted to me that an aspiring guardian could do far worse than to find a full copy of that book.'",
