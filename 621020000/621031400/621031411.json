The three of us came west to seek our rightful home: me, my younger brother Dúsek, and my eldest brother Lékhun. I wish now we had stayed in the East, but what sense is there in dwelling upon it? My brothers were both slain when the Frost-horde attacked, and now it falls on me alone to fulfil the purpose with which we set out.

Until that day, I will bear Krúvzhar and Ránkova with me, but they will not see battle.\\n\\n'The Zhélruka were promised a place in Gundabad, long ago, but they never reached it. Do you think your friend Durin will honour this ancient offer if he is able to retake the mountain from the Orcs? I do not mind telling you I have my doubts, [placeholder].\\n\\n'But that is a worry for the future. For now I think of my fallen brothers and mourn that they will not see the gates of Gundabad, or the crags of Elderslade, or the famed Reikfoss of Greylin. Ah! I have had an idea.
