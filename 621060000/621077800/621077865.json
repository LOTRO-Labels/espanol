I've been volunteering to bring messages from the city to the two beacons to show him how responsible I am, but...'\\n\\nHe glances at his father Angbor and lowers his voice so much that you can barely hear him.\\n\\n'Well, you see, I was on my way back from the beacons with a bag full of missives for my father when I was attacked by some annoyingly aggressive avanc. I managed to get away, but they snatched my bag from me! I haven't told him yet that I've lost it, but maybe with your help I won't have to!\\n\\n'Can you look for it? Uhm, I admit I'm not sure I remember exactly where I lost it. There was a waterfall nearby! I remember that much! Listen, it was dark, okay? And I was running... anyhow, look for my pack near one of the waterfalls between here and the beacons. Oh, and if you can exact a vicious revenge upon those overgrown lizards, so much the better!'",
