Some men that were under Hebil's command have captured the beacon between Lamedon and this fine wooded Vale. I am sure they are up there right now thinking they are the best corsairs in all of Gondor but you and I know that they are just idiots. Look my friend, go up there and rough them up for me, will you? Wipe the smiles off their faces. Take back the beacon if you want as well. I do not understand Gondorians, but you seem to like them. Well, back to my pint! I'll see you again when you're done?'\\n\\n<rgb=#FF0000>This bounty can only be completed a maximum of three times.</rgb>",
