With each strike their Fervour grows, allowing them to use even more potent skills. Special stances may be used to greatly increase damage dealt at the cost of defence or enhance defence at the cost of damage. In fellowships, a Champion concentrates on engaging as many foes as possible.</li>\\n\\n<li><rgb=#FFFF00>Lore:</rgb> Unrelenting in battle, Champions are the consummate warriors. A Champion cares not for his own well-being, but relies on his strength and prowess to slay the Enemy before they can bring more destruction to Middle-earth.\\n\\nThis class is inspired by Gimli son of Gl√≥in, whose skill in arms matched the bow-skills of Legolas.</li> ",
