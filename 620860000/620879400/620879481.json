This resistance has taken the guise and mantle of the Boar-clan, the Turch-lûth, as a symbol of defiance. Why, you may ask?\\n\\n'The Turch-lûth were a clan of the Algraig in the land to the north you call Enedwaith. When the Turch-lûth refused to bow to Saruman, the Draig-lûth destroyed them almost utterly.\\n\\n'The people here in the lower village are all that remain of the true Turch-lûth. Madin Brenin's grandfather gave them refuge out of kindness, but Madin himself has placed them under thralldom. They are now little more than slaves of the White Hand. I ask that you go now into the village and speak with the People of the Boar and learn what you can do to help them.'",
