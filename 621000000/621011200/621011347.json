It was not the howl of one wolf, no, it could not be; it seemed to be the howling of every wolf that ever stalked the high crags of the mountains. But one was first. One set them all going, and I named him Moorstalker, larger and more frightening than the others.\\n\\n'My brethren call me mad, but I know what I heard. I offer a reward for any who can bring down Moorstalker and the others of his pack. Let the Ered Mithrin no longer echo with the sound of their call, and I will know my reward was well-earned!'",
