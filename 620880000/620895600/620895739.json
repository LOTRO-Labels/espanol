They had forded the Great River at the Undeeps and sought to crush our forces here before sweeping into Gondor proper. While we fought valiantly, there was nothing we could do to stop the onslaught of Easterlings. My fellows and I were sent north to seek the aid of the North-men in desperation.\\n\\n'With us, we each carried a trinket. Before I fell, I buried the trinket in hopes that my failure would be forgotten. However, having returned, I know that can never be the case. I would ask that you seek it out. I buried it just outside the walls of Ost Celebrant. Perhaps it still remains there.'",
