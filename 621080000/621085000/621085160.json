In addition, he wishes to learn if they have troubled the work at the ship-yards of Umbar Baharbêl. Ahûd nods and smirks.\\n\\n'Tumúldo chose wisely, I think. Age has not slowed Eshmun in the least, and though he might seem a kindly old man at first glance, he is every bit as vicious as his predecessor. The only difference between the two of them is that Eshmun fights for the people of the Free City... and, of course, that he did not end up in the waters of the harbour with a spear through his back.\\n\\n'Nevertheless, I can say with certainty that none of the Heirsworn have troubled this ship-yard. I have only employed shipmen from the sailors' guild since the Mutiny, and even so, I have conducted routine inspections of these ships at every stage of their construction. I have seen the Heirsworn cowering at their ships at the edges of the harbour, but aside from petty theft and harassment, they pose little threat to our work here in the Sail-haven. It seems they mean to pillage the city and scatter like rats before the Kindred can slay the last of them. I say let them! Death would be a kindness for them—let them suffer their shame in exile!'",
