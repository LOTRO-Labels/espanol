They hunted Orcs in Théoden King's lands, but not at his command. Indeed, even Éomer my captain hunts Orcs without leave of the King. But he is the King's own kin, and will rule in Rohan someday. These others made bold claims, but I do not know the truth of them. Éomer let them go, that they might seek their lost companions, but only on condition that they return and present themselves to the King at Edoras. This they swore to do.'",
