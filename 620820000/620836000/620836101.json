It is the habit of many of us who have known either of them to spend time upon the hill in the sunshine, reflecting upon the sacrifices they have made for each other. It is a good way to put one's problems into perspective, among other things.\\n\\n'Would you like to do so as well? It must be during the day: as Aragorn said when they spoke their promises, neither the Shadow, which he always repudiates, nor the Twilight is for him, being mortal.
