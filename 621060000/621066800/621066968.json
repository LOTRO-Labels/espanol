I wish we had been able to fight alongside them, but we weren't aware of the attack until after it was repelled. Still, we will be sure to help them rebuild.\\n\\n'You've never heard of Lhan Garan you say? I would expect not, as we only recently built it! As such, if you have settled your matters in Mossward, I would invite you to visit us north of here along the Wadewater. We had to leave much behind when we left Dunland, and winter approaches quickly. Speak to our leader Talfryn. I'm sure he'll have plenty of work for an adventurer.'",
