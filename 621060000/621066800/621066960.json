However, when the Great Plague swept across Cardolan, its rulers could no longer keep up with the needed repairs.\\n\\nTharbad met its final demise slowly, as the elements battered the weakened structures. Finally, after the Fell Winter, a sudden thaw created a rushing wall of water that decimated the last bits of the crossings over the Gwathló and ruined the Great Bridge once and for all.\\n\\nNow the ruined city clings to the banks of a river whose hungry currents carry away more and more of its jagged remains every year.",
