I hope you do not mind my intrusion, but I have not seen you at the Dragonbone Inn before today, and it seems to me you must have an interesting story or two to tell! This is my third-favourite drinking spot, and I never miss an opportunity to sample the local brew whenever chance brings me through Lake-town, as it has today. Another opportunity I never miss: learning more about the folk who cross my path, and the adventures that led them to cross it!\\n\\n'I am called Authi Gem-cutter, and I am at your service, of course! What brings you to the Dragonbone Inn? We do not see many hobbits in this part of the world, but I am familiar with your kind even so. I came back to the Lonely Mountain when our exile ended, and I am grateful for the bravery of your king, Bilbo Baggins, on behalf of Durin's Folk!'\\n\\nYou tell Authi that you are not really from the same land as Bilbo, and you are pretty sure he isn't really a king in the land he calls home. Authi laughs heartily and strokes his beard.\\n\\n'Perhaps you are being modest on his behalf? If he was not a king, surely Bilbo Baggins was an important figure in this Shire all the same! I have never been there, though I am something of a traveller myself; it runs in my family, but I take most joy in the fashioning of complex trinkets and the improvement of my handiwork. Of late I have been less successful, I'm afraid, and it is not just my own craft that suffers!'",
