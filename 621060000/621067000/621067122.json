With a look of amusement, he rubs the two legs together and produces an unusual sound. It is not the song of the Neekerbreekers, but there is a certain musical quality to it.\\n\\n'A fascinating find, friend! To be honest, I have never been fond of the songs of the Neekerbreekers, but I'm certain I'll find an interesting use for theseâ€”in time, anyway!\\n\\n'If you find anything else of this sort, please bring it here and I'll see that you're compensated for your efforts. Thank you, friend!'",
