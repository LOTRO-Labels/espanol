Those with the strength of ten steeds!\\n\\nI am much more of a scholar than a hero. After the war I stayed at Minas Tirith, where I learned to write. I have made it my life's work to record the history of my people. The earliest account of the Rohirrim places our origins in the Vales of Anduin and the Wells of Langflood.\\n\\nI have been told that you recently visited the Vales and are in good graces with their protector, Grimbeorn. I humbly request to accompany you on this journey so that I may further catalogue and preserve the history of my people. I shall meet you at Grimbeorn's lodgings.\\n\\n- Léothred",
