I have discovered why, but we just have not had the numbers to do anything about it. Not long after you freed Rantost, several boats landed on the shore here. I watched a meeting between the newly-arrived tomb-robbers and the forces of Angmar. Afterwards, the robbers headed up into the hills, and the Angmarim resumed their search.\\n\\n'I can only fathom that an accord was struck. The tomb-robbers would spy for Angmar and report on our movements from above. In return, Angmar would give the robbers any relics from the city that they did not want.\\n\\n'If we are to move forward into the Way of Kings, the ancient burial ground of our ancestors' rulers, our actions must be shrouded to the Enemy. For that to happen, we must empty the hills and claim them for ourselves.'",
