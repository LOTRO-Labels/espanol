It seems that some of the patrons have been complaining of terrible wailing noises coming from the walls and floor in the cellar. I'm sure it's nothing, but business hasn't been great lately what with the rumours that the inn is haunted!\\n\\n'Now, I'm too busy to waste my time on hogwash like that myself, but perhaps you might be interested in taking a look? If naught else, you could confirm that it's a rumour and nothing more....\\n\\n'I should warn you, though, the customers don't normally start complaining about the noises until about midnight, so you'll probably have to hang around here until then. I'll even throw in as much ale as you can drink to help you pass the time!'",
