It is not a weapon, nor was it meant to be anything of the kind. It is a long song of memory, woven by Sangemêkh after Sangemêkh across many lives of the Chayasír, and the song gives strength. A strength meant to sustain, and bring together, and give hope. In truth, I do not think many would become as Athálrik did, handling the Bilitang un-trained. I think there must have been some sour knot within his heart from long before.\\n\\n'But thanks to you, all is right again.
