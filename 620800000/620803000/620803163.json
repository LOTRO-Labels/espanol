And I warn you, not all of my kinsmen will be as welcoming as I. Be courteous, be wary, and be silent unless spoken to.\\n\\n'I am open-minded, however. If I am given three reports of your worth, you will be granted the tolerance of the Lumi-väki. My son, Kaj, seeks aid in some endeavour or other. I have not the time to attend to it. You might begin with him; he is standing just to the east. And now that I think of it, Niko, our Master of the Hunt, has been looking more harried than usual lately; follow the road south-west and you can find him at his camp on the north side. He may not welcome your assistance, though; he does not think much of Sivullinen. Lauri, my best scout, may also need assistance. You can find him near the stable-master.'",
