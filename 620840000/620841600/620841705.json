His trust in me was misplaced, for we have come to ruin here in this twisted place! Few of my scouts have returned at all, but worst of all is the loss of poor Hal Tiller!\\n\\n'Hal was a young hobbit of an unusually adventurous strain who begged to join us in this expedition. He was also a burglar with an unusually light step -- even for his kind -- and of such earnest heart that I accepted... and in so doing I surely signed the warrant for his death. My fellow scouts were all of fine mettle and experience, and the risks they knew well, but poor Hal was but a child compared to them, and I should never have allowed it.\\n\\n'I cannot abandon my watch for my duty to the Malledhrim is clear and should any of my scouts yet live they shall come here. Yet you are clearly an adventurer of great mettle to have come this far yourself -- would you help me discover the fate of poor Hal? There must be some trace of him in the Scuttledells....'",
