I knew King Arvedui in life. He deserves a better fate than to linger in the frozen wastes, tormented by his past. Relieving him of his burden will be no easy task, however.'\\n\\nElrond furrows his brow, deep in thought.\\n\\n'Truthfully, I do not know how best to help him. In my experience, shades of Men often linger in the world because of something unfinished: an oath unfulfilled, an oath broken. Perhaps if you spend time with Arvedui, you will learn why he lingers, and find a way to relieve his burden. To that end, I have a request that might lead to salvation for the fallen king and also thwart the Enemy.'\\n\\nElrond motions to the book on the table, and opens it to a page marked with a piece of tasseled cloth. You see that it contains a list of many dated entries, logging something. The seven-pointed star of Arnor illustrates one of the pages.\\n\\n'As you have seen, Angmar has committed many forces to Forochel, conscripting the local Gauredain into their ranks, sending more soldiers than necessary for the purpose we believed they possessed. They are searching for something, and I have finally found a clue as to what that might be. \\n\\n'This record recovered from Annúminas details significant troop movements from the years 500 to 600 of the Third Age. There, on that page, it states that a large contingent of soldiers and Prince Elendur himself moved an \\qitem of great importance\\q from Ost Forod into the North. It does not declare what this item is, or where precisely it came to rest. I have a suspicion as to what it might be, and if I am correct, it is surely what the Angmarim seek in the frozen wilds of Forochel.\\n\\n'First, I would ask you to seek the Ranger known as Lothrandir. I believe he is still among the Lossoth, and should you encounter the Angmarim in force, I fear you will have need of his sword-arm. Together, bring this information to Arvedui. As the King of Arthedain, he may know where this secret treasure was hidden by the Arnorians all those years ago.\\n\\n'If fate is kind, you will find the treasure before the Angmarim can seize it for their dark masters. If it is kinder still, you will also find a way to put Arvedui's spirit to rest. I wish you luck, [placeholder].'",
