I doubted much of note remained after the Heirs of Castamir were routed, but part of me still feared there could be some new conspiracy afoot. It is reassuring to know that my fears were ill-founded.\\n\\n'Thank you, my friend. I am glad that the King thought to send you on his behalf!'",

However, aside from those who returned from the War, we do have one unexpected guest, and that would be that man over there named Bregon.'\\n\\nAmathon sighs.\\n\\n'He seems a rough sort, and by his own admission, he was a freebooter during the War. He says he was run out of Tarlang's Crown by Corsairs, but I thought that the Heir of Castamir, Azruthor, who led them was slain. Why would they linger there eking out the meagre life of a highwayman when they could surely find better fortunes elsewhere? Is Umbar in such a poor state that this seems the wiser choice? I do not know for certain, but from what I have heard, there is something afoot across the Bay of Belfalas.\\n\\n'Why don't you talk to Bregon and see what you make of his claims?'",

There's a bunch of Corsairs making trouble in Tarlang's Crown and snooping about at that old camp. Yes, it is true that I was something of a freebooter during the War, but I've learned my lesson.
