They have not accomplished much, though... they fear the spirits and try to avoid them, for when the spirits find them, they do attack, and the robbers lose more than win.\\n\\n'The robbers within the ruins present two problems. They are slowly carting off our legacy, and they are not allowing the spirits to be at rest. I wish you to drive the tomb-robbers out... we shall see if that helps to quiet the ruins.'",
