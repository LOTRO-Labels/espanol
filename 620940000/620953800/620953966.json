It is true that we have been faced with many a setback as of late, but we must not dwell on these past failures. My brother, Azruthor, sought to treat with the Dead on our behalf, but his weakness in the face of would-be warriors of Dol Amroth instead left us with a bitter enemy. The Dead scattered our men at Linhir, but I have seen them rush from these lands to the East. They shall meddle in our affairs no longer!\\n\\nAt long last, the time has come to claim the throne - those of you on land are to renew the attack on Linhir, while the rest of us sail for Pelargir!\\n\\nI ask this of you all - look upon our fleet along the coast, and see what awaits the men of Pelargir! Of this I am certain - there shall be no defeat for us here. Once again, the line of Castamir will rule and the foolish men that rally to the side of Denethor shall be yours to slay - a just reward for your roles in restoring the true King of Gondor!",
