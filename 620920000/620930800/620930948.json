He always told such stories about them the likes of which you wouldn't believe.\\n\\n'They say that an Elf Queen has been teaching him to grow the biggest taters a person could ever hope to see.  Leave it to Bilbo to go all the way off to the Elves to gain knowledge just so he can steal the first prize ribbon from Farmer Maggot at one of these Farmers Faires!\\n\\n'Some folks would just try harder in their own garden plot, but Bilbo just couldn't never do anything the easy way when he could have an adventure instead. I imagine he'll be back any day to wipe that smug smirk off of Farmer Maggot and break his sixty-year winning streak.'",
