Things have not improved of late in the vicinity of Bree - it would seem that more bandits than decent folk now inhabit the hills and grow bolder than ever in their assaults upon travellers.\\n\\nThanks to you though, the people of Bree have had someone to look up to despite these hardships. Your quests and travails have proven that there are some at least who can stand up against this lawlessness.\\n\\nIndeed, your story has begun to spread amongst the folk of Bree, with little help or embelishment from me, I might add - though I am looking forwards to telling one or two of your more interesting tales to this evening's crowds.'",
