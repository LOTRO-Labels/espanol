Today I am catching fish, but river oysters are a celebrated Ambarûli delicacy. Would you like to gather some? It is very easy. The water is shallow enough in places that all you have to do is pick them up!\\n\\n'Go ahead, look around in the shallows and find some oysters. When you are done, I will take them off your hands. What is that? Am I trying to get you to do my work for me?'\\n\\nThe fisherman gives you a lighthearted laugh and winks at you.\\n\\n'Well... yes. Will you do it?'",
