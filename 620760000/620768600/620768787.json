They utilize their Trick skills to debuff foes and can later remove the Tricks for additional benefits. Burglars also have Stealth skills and are proficient at initiating Fellowship Manoeuvres. In fellowships, a Burglar supports his allies by debuffing foes, while dealing respectable damage.</li>\\n\\n<li><rgb=#FFFF00>Lore:</rgb> Burglars are masters of stealth and misdirection.
