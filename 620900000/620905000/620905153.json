When I was last in these lands, he was a man of short temper and did not believe the King was strong enough to protect Rohan from what threatened her. I cannot imagine he has changed, but it is good to see he is making Harwick ready for whatever may come. These steeds are of good breeding, and should serve us well. Nona has not lived her life among horses, but still she has done very well to pick it up in short order. War-steeds are different from the horses she may have had occasion to ride in the past, and she has adjusted well. Corudan, too, is already at home on the back of his steed. We will make good time over the plains.'",
