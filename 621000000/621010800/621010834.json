Aye, I did my part in lifting it! I cannot imagine there have been events of import enough to send a messenger so soon.\\n\\n'My older brother Thorin did little in the way of fighting during the war. We have always been different, and ladies of our mutual acquaintance will happily tell you that my blood runs hotter than his, and my temper too! It is not a slight, do not take it as such! He is the King Under the Mountain and I am the Lord of the Ironfort and Iron Hills, both stations of importance, but I am sworn to serve him. I would serve him regardless, for he is my elder and dear to me, but he is also my king, and that alone merits respect.\\n\\n'You are here for his son? When the Easterlings brought their war through the Ironfold, Thorin sent word to me that Durin was to remain within the Ironfort, and I saw it done. Afterward I marched to the Lonely Mountain and there engaged in such battle as you would hardly believe! Stranded atop one of the spurs of the Mountain I was, wielding the Black Mattock with unheralded ferocity. Well, I have heralded it aplenty now to my minstrels, so in time folk from all about will hear the tale, or my minstrels will have an earful to match this golden one I earned following the battle!\\n\\n'If it had been up to me, Durin would have come with me to the fighting. Alas it was not. His father has always been a cautious sort. The boy was not happy about staying behind, and he spends most of his days deep in his cups, drowning his resentment and his boredom. Go to the Quenching Trough, his preferred tavern, and give him the news that his father seeks him. He will surely be pleased.'",
