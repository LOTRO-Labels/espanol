A great evil was committed here, and I did not speak against it; for that I am cursed, never to find rest or peace.\\n\\n'I arranged for your friend to find my old book of recipes, for I wanted nothing more than to pass on the activities that gave me such joy in life, when joy was possible. But I know now that it can never be, and it was the sense of family, the sense of belonging that I truly missed.\\n\\n'Mirkwood was not always called such! Once it was Greenwood the Great, and the Woodmen thrived beneath its canopy. The recipes I wrote for my people made exclusive use of the herbs and creatures that dwelled within, but so many of them will never return, and those meals will never be made again. Such is the nature of my curse: all else will change, but I will not.\\n\\n'Watching the two of you has been bittersweet, but it dispelled my loneliness for a time, no matter how briefly. I thank you for that kindness.'",
