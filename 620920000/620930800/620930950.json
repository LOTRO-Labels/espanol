Well, as it happens I heard that he's not in some far off land at all, he's still right here, in the Shire!\\n\\n'That whole party business was an elaborate ruse to set people talking and rumouring and thinking that he's in some far-off land, having more adventures.  That was just Bilbo's way of creating a distraction while he crept away to hide in plain sight!\\n\\n'Folks say that at night you can sometimes see him, clothed in black, face hidden behind a dark mask with an even darker cape all flapping and flowing behind him, riding along the roads of the Shire.  He's turned vigilante, protecting us all from bandits and goblins and anything else nasty trying to creep into our towns!\\n\\n'Bilbo's managed to stay out of sight so well due to his hidden hobbit-holes all over the Shire.  They were built in secret and paid for by his fortune, and he roams between these, never spending too much time in any one spot, always listening and waiting for danger to appear!'",
