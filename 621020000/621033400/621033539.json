By the by, wedding season is the most important time of year for a flower monger like myself.

This week I have the misfortune of being stuck in this smouldering pile of rocks. Mmmf, my head.\\n\\n'Where was I? Oh yes, I seem to have imbibed a bit more than I am accustomed to last evening. Ah, don’t look at me like that! Do you have any inkling how difficult it is to keep roses fresh from my farm to here?! The stress nearly eats you alive! I've probably gone down an entire tunic size! So I might have had more than I should have to drink. What do you care? You’re not my wife! Wait, you’re not my wife, are you?'\\n\\nThe merchant squints up at you with bleary eyes.\\n\\n'No, no you aren’t. Right, listen. You help me out and I’ll make it worth your while!\\n\\n'You hear that ruckus? Someone in this tavern fancies themselves a bard, but a croaking frog has more melody than that cacophony.
