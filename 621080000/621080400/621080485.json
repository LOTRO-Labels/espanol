You have not let down your own folk, as I have, surely? I cannot imagine that. You were always stronger in mind than I was, with courage to spare. It is the truth, and we both know it. And Nona was... Nona was stronger than both of us. But... what do you have to say of yourself? You are not running away from something. You were always running... toward.'\\n\\nBefore you can gather your thoughts to speak, someone steps close behind you.

When you have finished, he rubs his eyes.\\n\\n'After the Battle of Pelennor Fields, I wandered without purpose. I came to this land because I did not want to get involved, but even that proved a lie. I called myself Bymerë at first, and told myself Horn was dead. But as I lived here, drowning my old sorrows with ale and trying to forget what I had done and what I had been, I saw crimes I could not forgive; as I opposed them I took on a new name: Driftwood. I believed the Heirs of Castamir might again threaten Gondor... and if they had victory there, would not Rohan be next? So I made things difficult for them, as I could. I thought I might gain an audience with Balakhôr's widow if I claimed to have slain one of her enemies, and so end the threat of the Heirs of Castamir.\\n\\n'Most of my plans ended in the bottom of a mug of ale, [placeholder]. When I was Horn, and fought alongside friends, it was different. Driftwood is alone, and accomplishes nothing. It is useless.'\\n\\nYou tell Horn that it could be different, and he shakes his head.\\n\\n'This is my place now. I spend my days fighting Corsairs and my nights here, drowning in my cups.
