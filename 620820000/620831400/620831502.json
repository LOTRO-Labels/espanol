Together I hope we can bring light to this place.\\n\\n'I see great strength in you, but doubt also. And where there is doubt, there is dread, and morale can wither and break under such strain. But fear not -- you need naught but inspiration, which may then be used to infuse your heart with newfound power and will. \\n\\n'I can help you in this regard. To begin this last leg of your journey, I would have you acquire an instrument that once belonged to a great Minstrel. Legend has it that this piece could be well heard singing high above the clamour of battle, drowning out fear, anguish, and even death with its clear music. I have learned that an Orc, Shîk, has been seen with this instrument here in the Foundations of Stone.\\n\\n'They say that Shîk likes to play in the foetid pools along the northern edges of the Foundations of Stone and is especially fond of the waterfalls that feed them. Go and recover the instrument, and then return to me.'",
