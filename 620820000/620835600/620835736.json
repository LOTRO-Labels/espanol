Are you looking at that maze yonder? That is just what I was thinking of too. It is a fine day indeed to be lost in the foliage!\\n\\n'So you wish to try your luck at picking a path? That is a worthy goal. I went just the other day, in record time. I'll warrant you can't get through even if I gave you a more than generous amount of time. In fact, I'd be willing to wager a fair prize on that very challenge.\\n\\n'Give a shout if you get lost and need me to come looking! I'll not think less of you -- some people get quite lost in such a confusion of ways. But do not walk so quick that you forget to savour the sweet smells of green growing things, for you'll not find them any other time of year.'",
