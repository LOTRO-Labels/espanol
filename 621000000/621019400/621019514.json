I do not blame him for this. One of pure heart can only endure so much cruelty. These evil Men became maddened by the new power that they were never meant to carry. They cared only for the beasts they worshiped. Over the years they became the Guaradain, the wolf-men, and the Ungoledain, these spider-men. This is why we must assist the Woodmen. The threat they face now is due to my carelessness. We must find their encampment and find their leader, this Mengris Tásakh.'",
