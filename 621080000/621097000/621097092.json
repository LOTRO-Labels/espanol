Civil war shattered the great Shârate of Hamât. Ambarûl remained loyal to Queen Luzími, as did the rest of the Ikorbâni, and fought for her and then her heirs for more than a hundred years. Gondor then broke its neutrality and sent soldiers to the aid of the loyalists, not out of friendship, but to counter the Khandari who had thrown their weight behind the eastern rebels.\\n\\nThis saved the loyalists from defeat. Merchants of the great city of Jaghâna then brokered a peace that split Hamât into two separate realms. Under this truce, Ambarûl owed fealty to neither, being a part of the Ibili lands, so named for the council of wise men chosen by the merchants of Jaghâna to serve as a shield between the two rival realms. This brought peace, but the Years of Joy did not return. The wounds of the Madâr cut deep, but war-weariness crept into Men's bones and a quiet settled over Shagâna. All was not always calm between Hamât and Erêsh, but with both Gondor and the merchants of Jaghâna invested in maintaining the truce, the Ibili council kept war at bay.'",
