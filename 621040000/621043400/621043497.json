Molkha has located an Angmarim camp to the south-east, not far from here, called Mullach Cagar. I trust you, mighty [placeholder], can handle a small group of Angmarim on your own. I am going to stay here with Molkha to attack this nest of drakes. If you would prefer to handle the drakes yourself before we move on, I will not stop you! Most importantly, I need you to find some evidence of why the Angmarim chose to come all the way up to the Welkin-lofts in the first place. They risked much to get this far.'",
