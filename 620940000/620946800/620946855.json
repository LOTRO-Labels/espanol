Indeed, we sent another of our Elves, Pothlorn, to scout the path to the ruins of Ost Thondol. Wolves were seen in that direction as well, and we wished to know how widespread their roaming had become. Alas, we have had no word from Pothlorn.\\n\\n'Would you search for Pothlorn along that path and learn if he still lives? It may be that some ill has befallen him... and even then, we wish to know of his fate.\\n\\n'That path begins just to the east and travels into the northern Gorges, swinging eastward away from Nan Tornaeth.'",
