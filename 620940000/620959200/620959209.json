Few others have heard me on this matter, but you seem the kind to heed the tales of strangers.\\n\\n'In my youth, I often travelled the lands of Lebennin and spent much time upon the banks of its rivers. I knew well of the legends of our people as did all other children of Lebennin, but that was not the reason for my wandering. My father had taken ill in summer, and the disease claimed him by spring. My mother went silent for a year's time, and all looked upon me as a child of madness and misfortune. My only respite was in walking the banks of the Five Rivers, and so I went.\\n\\n'The Erui was nearest to my home, and it, too, knew well of tragedy and death. It was there that King Eldacar slew the Usurper long ago, but many others fell and bloodied its shallows before the battle came to an end. It is said that the last of the Five Sisters, the Lone Lady of Erui, once looked upon our people with fondness, but the horrors that occurred in her waters led her to spirit herself away. It may seem a different tale from my own, but I have not yet reached its ending....\\n\\n'You see, I sat near the falls at the Crossings one day and was overcome by the sadness of my family's fate. As I dried my tears, I saw something that has not left my mind in all my years. I saw the image of a woman's face gazing upon me from behind the falls. I dashed into the water and called out, but as soon as I drew close to the falls, the face had gone. To this day, I know the Lone Lady appeared before me and ever since, I have held close my belief in the Sisters.\\n\\n'The Haradrim do not respect our lands or rivers as we do, and they do not know to fear the ire of the Five Sisters. The Lone Lady should not again suffer the blood of Men in her waters, and I ask that you seek her out at the Crossings as I once did. May she watch over Lebennin and keep us from the evils of war!'",
