I fear a great evil has bound them here, and they have become dangerous.\\n\\n'Take both pieces of the amulet and seek out several of the unusual cairn stones that dot the landscape. These ancient cairn stones are covered with inscriptions that are much older than those that surround them. The inscriptions on these stones match that of the amulet and can hopefully be used to help mend it to its original shape.\\n\\n'Travel to the south-east and locate several of these cairn stones. Place the amulet upon them, then bring me word of the effects, if any, you witness.'",
