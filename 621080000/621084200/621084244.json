Our lures are as good and our hands as quick as ever. It's the trout themselves that have changed. They have turned a pallid, slimy green, afflicted with some terrible disease. We know not why. Some of the hands have taken to calling it the stench, for obvious reasons. We cannot eat or sell any of the fish we catch, it makes any who eat it violently ill.\\n\\n'I'll be honest with you, moreso than perhaps Roshat was – we really could use your help. We rely on the fish to fill our bellies and our coin pouches. I know Roshat has suspicions about the source of the disease, but he won't trust outsiders unless he sees your value.\\n\\n'I don't know how to heal our fish, but I know how you could help fill our bellies and perhaps gain his trust. There are crabs to the east of here, along the shore, just beyond the village. They seem to be immune to the stench, at least so far. However, they fight back more than we gentle fisherfolk can handle.\\n\\n'Would you go to the east and bring us back some crab to feed our people?'",
