They are Sarláshi trees, with which we make Veróthi. Our Veróthi are living links to the Kintai who have undergone Trothúl, the Wearying. We give them the reverence and respect Men have for their entombed dead in sarcophagi.\\n\\n'Our Veróthi require fresh Sarláshi trees with which to grow. Vartúlin's trees no longer produce shoots, as they are near the end of their life cycle, as are we who tend them.\\n\\n'There is an area west of here with younger Sarláshi trees. This is the grove of Róthirin. I must warn you however, there are vengeful Curthádi spirits, Kintai who became wrathful or vengeful at the despoiling of the forests, who roam Róthirin. It is no longer safe for the Kintai to venture there. You, however, have the bearing of one who can handle yourself in a fight.\\n\\n'It is our ancestral duty to plant more Sarláshi trees here in Vartúlin, that we have enough for all the Kintai Elves who undergo Trothúl. Go to Róthirin and gather us fresh Sarláshi shoots, that they may be replanted here in Vartúlin and grow into full Sarláshi trees. I am trusting you with something quite sacred to us, [placeholder]. I know you will not let me down.'",
