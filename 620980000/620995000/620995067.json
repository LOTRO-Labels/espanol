It came from elsewhere, and the corruption that envelops it stems from its long stay in the Black Land. If this evil could be cleansed, I believe that Elrond could imbue it with a powerful and vital force for Good.\\n\\n'Before that can happen, however, we must do something about the corruption that Mordor has worked upon it. There are different methods to accomplish this, though the Wise disagree upon the effectiveness of each. My preferred means for such a cure is to bring the corrupted item to the place where it was made, or to places of some significance upon its path, and to thereby diffuse the foul touch of Mordor that has, in the interim, claimed it. We must learn the story of this heirloom before it came to Mordor.'\\n\\nThe Wizard turns the artifact over in his hands, studying it for some clue to its origin. To your eye the heirloom is a stone key, with many angular corners and smooth sides.\\n\\n'The origin of this artifact is no mystery, [placeholder], for its shape and the runes upon it state as clearly as possible from where it came. This key opens a door in Moria, in Khazad-dûm.\\n\\n'But which door and where? That will be the real mystery. Perhaps the best place to start is with the Iron Garrison. Look for dwarves in the Twenty-first Hall that proclaim themselves lock-masters, and they will no doubt have a catalogue of locks to which this key may fit. Unlocking the door may cleanse the key of its corruption.'",
