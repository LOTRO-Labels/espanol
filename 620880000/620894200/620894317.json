      "en": "Careful study, precise action, a sound understanding of the natural world...these are the talents of the Lore-master. Your friends will rely upon you and your knowledge of ancient lore to defeat the strongest of enemies.\\n\\nYou should always be sure to garner the aid of your friends in the wild. A raven, for example, makes an excellent ally. It can distract your foes and allow you the time and distance to unleash your most powerful attacks. Your control over fire, light, wind, and other natural forces will allow you and your fellows to outwit your enemies. That said, if you simply decide to club your foes with a staff, without proper preparation, you will likely find yourself in dire straits.\\n\\nA Lore-master knows the power of distraction, and in the end, this will be your mark. A flash of light or a gust of wind may be exactly the kind of distraction you need to overcome more dangerous opponents.\\n\\nWhere armoured heroes will excel with brute force, you must use your mind. With a careful plan -- and perhaps a trusty bear to watch your back -- you are sure to succeed in our war against the Enemy.\\n\\n-T.",
