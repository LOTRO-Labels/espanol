We season mushrooms with spices stored in a larder here in Ukhbab-gairu to lift up our spirits and put a spring in our step. We also fish the stream running through the depths and season them with spices, and mushrooms to make it easier to haul and carry ore and ingredients.\\n\\n'Cooks are well-rewarded for their efforts here in Ukhbab-gairu.'",
