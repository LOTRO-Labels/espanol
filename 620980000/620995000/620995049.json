It came from elsewhere, and the corruption that envelops it stems from its long stay in the Black Land. If this evil could be cleansed, I believe that Elrond could imbue it with a powerful and vital force for Good.\\n\\n'Before that can happen, however, we must do something about the corruption that Mordor has worked upon it. There are different methods to accomplish this, though the Wise disagree upon the effectiveness of each. My preferred means for such a cure is to bring the corrupted item to the place where it was made, or to places of some significance upon its path, and to thereby diffuse the foul touch of Mordor that has, in the interim, claimed it. We must learn the story of this heirloom before it came to Mordor.'\\n\\nThe Wizard turns the artifact over in his hands, studying it for some clue to its origin. To your eye the heirloom is a small carved sculpture of a woman. One hand is raised before her, as if in warding, and in the other she holds a spear ready to throw.\\n\\n'This sculpture was carved from a bone or tusk, but I cannot say what creature lent the material used in its manufacture.
