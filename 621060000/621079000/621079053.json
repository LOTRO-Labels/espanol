      "en": "The swan-knights owe their allegiance to Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth, but they serve too at the command of the King of Gondor, and I know King Elessar holds Rossaran in high esteem, for both his loyalty and his martial skill. Rossaran would be a valuable member of the crew, but I cannot write his name without mentioning one complication that worries my conscience. As we travelled across King's Gondor he spoke often of his wife Bruidis, from whom he had been parted and greatly desired to see once again. Can we ask him to leave her again so soon?\\n\\nBruidis will know where her husband can now be found, and the question should be put to him, but if he refuses we should not pressure a different decision. I believe Bruidis can be found at Tadrent, in King's Gondor West.",
