If you did not bring such dire news I would greet you more heartily, but your tidings are troubling.\\n\\n'We of Mirkwood have indeed encountered these creatures before, but it is not something I expected to see again. A tribe of trolls once lived near Dol Guldur, and we who fought them called these creatures Wood-trolls. Once these were wandering, individual creatures, loath to unite or even live near to their fellows. At Dol Guldur, however, something caused them to join together. A king was raised among them, and he unified the Wood-trolls into a terrible force. My father sent many warriors to defeat the Wood-trolls, and it was done.\\n\\n'I believe something has once again united the Wood-trolls of the Trollshaws, [placeholder]. But this place is far from Mirkwood -- my father's warriors will not avail us.'",
