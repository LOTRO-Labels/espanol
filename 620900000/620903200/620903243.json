I have heard countless stories of crofters coming under siege from fearsome Orcs and other beasts, and I pray that Randgar remains yet safe.\\n\\n'I care deeply for Randgar, but my father will not allow me to see him. He knows that Randgar is poor and believes he is unworthy of our concern. Please, visit his farm and ensure his safety. I love Randgar, but I would rather he flee to Edoras than come to harm for my sake.'",
