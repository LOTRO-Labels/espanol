The first was much too large and the charge was given to your people to handle, that being a large shipment of food and brittleleaf.\\n\\n'The second was in my charge, and my pony -- loaned me by Captain-General Lainedhel himself -- was doing well until we were beset by the Snowreap goblins out of Grothum. Terrible creatures, those. Never had I seen one up close until that moment, and I admit that I was more than startled! I fought for a short time before they ran me off from the cart and pony. I know something terrible became of the pony, but the cargo I was hauling is most likely intact as many enjoy the spirits that we folk of Hoarhallow brew.\\n\\n'If you could, make your way north from here to Grothum and recover the ale for me. I would be very appreciative.'",
