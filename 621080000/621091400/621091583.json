I suppose,' she murmurs.\\n\\n'I was not always as I am, [placeholder]. I was like you... an adventurer-for-hire, accomplishing the small tasks... that needed doing. It was a simple life, but a good one. There was food on the table for my husband, Jedûth, and my daughter Ashenâth. But it... did not last.\\n\\n'My husband was accused... of stealing a vase from a wealthy nobleman, a man called Phirasâkh. He did not! I know he did not... but he was slain for the crime. I had to take on even more dangerous tasks to support my Ashenâth... even murder. That paid the finest of all, [placeholder], but the first victim of my knife was the sweetest: Phirasâkh, the nobleman who falsely-accused my Jedûth. He deserved the death I gave to him.\\n\\n'But I did not stop at Phirasâkh, for I had tasted the deadly nectar of death. I was away for longer and longer at a time; I told myself the coins I gave my neighbours to watch my daughter Ashenâth were all for her benefit. The name \\qGalatâni\\q no longer applied to me, for I had grown hard, and cold. I was now Hazêphen, \\qCruel Dancer,\\q and I delighted in the slaughter. Phirasâkh had deserved death. But he would not be the last, and some who died at the hands of Cruel Dancer deserved it less than he. Many did.\\n\\n'It was best for Ashenâth that her mother remain only a memory... for I had grown addicted to... the danger, [placeholder], and the sight of the blood I spilled. It had... become an obsession.'\\n\\nShe falls silent for a long moment, and you wonder if her life has ended, but then she coughs and sputters back to awareness.\\n\\n'The city was not a place of safety... in those years. The Church of the All-Seeing saw its... enemies everywhere. The neighbours who watched after my daughter were taken in sacrifice to the Mâkhda Khorbo, and their home burned. On that day Ashenâth joined her father, but when I returned to the burned frame that had been a home there was no vengeance to be had. The Dark Lord worshipped by the Church of the All-Seeing was not like... not like Phirasâkh. I could not be certain He even lived, and if He did not live... could He be slain?\\n\\n'I preyed upon the Church for a time, often for free, but when my coins ran out I had few choices left to me. I stopped returning to the burned husk where once I lived with my Jedûth and my Ashenâth. I only felt alive when I competed with other bounty-hunters for the most dangerous work I could find.'",
