Written by Elf-lords ages ago and still one of the finest texts a champion could wish to own. But look you here, this copy of yours is quite a bit older than any I have held, and some of the passages are different. It seems that you have stumbled upon something of great import.\\n\\n'After the wars of the Second Age saw their power begin to wane, the Elves thought perhaps it was not wise to leave such fine works in the art of war lying about where any Man, dwarf, or Orc could pick them up, so they rounded up most of the copies of this book and removed some of the more important bits. Most copies you see today are from the time after that, and while they are still fine works, it is safe to say that the best parts are hard to come by.\\n\\n'Now this copy of yours looks old enough to be from before that time, but it is pretty weathered and dog-eared. If you could find the missing pages, however, you would have yourself a complete copy of the original Tome of Swords, and in the hands of a seasoned champion, I can tell you that it would be worth more than its weight in gold.",
