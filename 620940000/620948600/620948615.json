That is where we would intercept our enemies and ensure it was only allies who passed on to the city.\\n\\n'The Corsairs have taken it as their own, and are choking off our fishermen and supplies. To make it worse, they have brought a pair of drakes with them. Fearsome beasts.\\n\\n'There is a small boat in the harbour that will take you there. Once there, keep your eyes open. I am sure there is more to deal with than just those drakes. Be warned, you will want friends with you.'",
