The tide slowly carried it to shore where it was buried within the dunes, forgotten until a crawler accidentally devoured it.\\n\\n'There were many ships that travelled the waters, and many storms that harried or wrecked them, particularly along this stretch of water. I wonder how many other pieces of jewellery fell overboard and made their way into the sands?\\n\\n'There is one way to know. Head back to where you found this piece and search the crawlers there for other pieces of jewellery. If any of them swallowed one, odds are more of them have as well. Return to me with whatever you find.'",
