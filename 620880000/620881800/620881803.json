The clan tightly controls who can have cattle and how many. There are tags that are sold and attached to the animals. If any animal is found without a tag, it is brought to auction, and Bedwur keeps whatever the profit is. He is also the one who sells the tags.\\n\\n'I had a herd of cattle that strayed too far to the east, and many were devoured by the Wargs. I have sold the herdsmen to the mines to regain some of my losses, but now I need enough to get started again. If you can get me the tags from my dead cattle, I will sell them at auction. They can be found around the rock to the east.'",
