By boiling the roots of this plant, he could extract the oils within and create a brew that was hearty enough to rouse a sleeping dragon! Well, that is what he claimed. I doubt he ever saw a dragon. Nevertheless, the brew was strong and could be put to use in helping our sick and wounded recover more quickly.\\n\\n'I have not seen such a plant in some time, but I am hopeful that it may be growing here in Tharâkh Bazân, as there are many pools and streams of fresh water to be found. If you come across any healthy roots growing near the water, please return them to me so that I may examine them.' ",
