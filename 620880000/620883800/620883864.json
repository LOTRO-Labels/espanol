I have come up with a theory by breaking down Nár's ramblings.\\n\\n'In the eastern part of Thrór's Comb is a cave. The sea of gold speaks of the treasure the Draig-lûth is bringing there. Around the cave entrance you will often see drakes sunning during the day. I believe they are the teeth and scales he refers to. The fire must be part of an offering the clan makes to the dragons they worship.\\n\\n'Head into the eastern hills of Thrór's Coomb and seek out this cave. If you find it, venture within and see if you find the weapons and armour you seek. If not, we can do nothing more for you. Be wary... I doubt the Draig-lûth will give up their treasures willingly.'",
