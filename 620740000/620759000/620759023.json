The thrush Snailbane saw dwarves carrying gold down from Thorin's Gate in the middle of the night... he did not understand the difference, but I can tell you as sure as the hair of my beard curls in winter that these were Dourhands! His sister Brighteye followed them for some time and learned their destination, but it doesn't make much sense to me. The Dourhands brought this gold into one of their old cities in the Vale of Thr√°in, but... that city has been occupied by goblins for several years now. Why would the Dourhands willingly bring gold into the domain of the goblins?\\n\\nNos Grimsong",
