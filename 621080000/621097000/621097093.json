Transcribed T.A. 736 \\n\\nWe lived in the shadow cast by Telperiën's Wall... daunting and impregnable. The eastern tyrant sent his riders both north and south to harry the less well-protected borders. Ambarûl unguarded, the Men of Númenor returned and seized control of much of Shagâna. Folk to the south and west rose up against our colonizers and we joined with them. When all was over, the Wall of Telperiën was sundered and the marshes once again answered to a Shâr, Urlûm Wrath-hand of Umbar. Under Urlûm's son Ulmêsh, we fell to Númenor again. Ulmêsh then travelled to the land of Mordor and with a new strength did repel our oppressors once more.\\n\\nThen from Númenor came a king who allied with southern traitors to bring Umbar and Ambarûl back under Númenórean rule. The king then returned to his island, leaving cruel lords to rule over us. They mistreated us and took many as captives to serve them. After wretched Númenor was swallowed by the sea, our lands fell into disarray. Men from the south swept in and seized control of much of Shagâna, aided by people called King's Men.'",
