He may arrive this very day, on the morrow, or perhaps months shall pass before at last he reveals himself. For that reason, I have spent many nights in wakefulness pondering the fate of Thikil-gundu in the Grey Mountains. Is that the fate that shall befall Erebor? Will the folk of Dale and Eryn Lasgalen soon know all too well the cold that overtook us in the North?\\n\\n'It does me no good to dwell on such thoughts, and indeed, there are more pressing matters this day.\\n\\n'Dís, the Keeper of Ravenhill and sister of Thorin Oakenshield, sent me an urgent summons requesting my presence at Ravenhill. It is a strange request, I think. There is no ill will between the ravens and Durin's Folk, but we have grown distant since the days of Roäc the raven-chief. His descendants are not known to me, and I do not think any in this realm have seen a raven of his stock in many years.\\n\\n'I would ask that you accompany me to Ravenhill, [placeholder]. If we have need to return swiftly to Erebor, we shall ride together.'",
