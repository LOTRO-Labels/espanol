Not long ago, a company of Orcs came through the hills of the East Wall and burned a town called Hytbold to the ground. This was an important part of our eastern defence against the Enemy, and I fear that without it Walstow will not hold for long.\\n\\n'I wish for you to go to Hytbold and lead the rebuilding effort. The work will be great, as the people of Rohan are already suffering much and do not have a great deal to give, but if you can defend them, serve them, and inspire them, they will answer your call and come to your aid.\\n\\n'I have dispatched Edgal to Hytbold. Find him there, and he will guide you through repairing and restoring this town so it may once more serve for the glory of the Rohirrim.'",
