Vicious, nasty creatures they are. Massive birds with talons like daggers, beaks strong enough to pierce the hull of even the sturdiest ships.\\n\\n'Well, I represent a wealthy buyer who is interested in acquiring one of these beasts for himself. Fancies if he raises the thing from birth, it'll be loyal. Could you imagine? The power of a roc tamed.\\n\\n'So here's the job: Go to the roc's nest south of here and nab one of their eggs. Bring it back to me, and you'll have enough coin to live comfortably for the rest of your life anywhere in the world.'\\n\\nAs you recall, Rocs are intelligent creatures, not the mere beasts that this brigand claims them to be. It may be worth warning the nearby rocs that someone has designs on their eggs.",
