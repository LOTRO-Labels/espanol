The rocks you have found appear to have been altered in some way, however. There is some unholy power in these sarrowstones that seems responsible for the mutations in the Wargs you have been battling.\\n\\n'I have crushed a few of these stones on my anvil and the corruption dissipates like dust when they are destroyed. I hear that you are heading north to battle more of the enemy at Malkorlash. Whilst there, shatter any sarrowstones you come across, my friend.'",
