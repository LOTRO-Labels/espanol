While the threats to it are not great, they must not be trivialized in their importance, for Tham Nambarth is being reclaimed by nature itself.\\n\\nTham Nambarth was once a great hall... you can see that in what still stands today. This will not be the case for long, though, and not because of looters or goblins. It is the ivy! It grows deep into the cracks in the walls and slowly pushes the bricks apart until nothing is left standing.\\n\\nIt is also threatened by a source that itself is not threatening: a herd of elk has settled within its walls. They are not a problem of themselves; however, soon they will bring predators: wolves, hungry robbers, Wargs, and goblins from the northern hills.",
