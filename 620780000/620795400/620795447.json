I tracked him down from the Gladdalf and into Nan Tornaeth, but he became frightened, and I lost the trail. I picked it up again amid the Bruinen Gorges and followed him south into the hills alongside this camp. The light was failing, and as he passed westward and I behind him, I loosed a number of my arrows. I know I felled him, [placeholder], but I could not follow in the dark.\\n\\n'He is out there, my friend: the hunter Wistan's greatest kill! If you come across the body of the white hart, collect my arrows and the carcass and bring them back to me. My hunt of the white hart will surely make for a fine tale or three about the fire, and there will be a place for you, as well!\\n\\n'The hart was making westward, but even taking his last strides, he would have steered clear of the Gauredain or the Wood-trolls.
