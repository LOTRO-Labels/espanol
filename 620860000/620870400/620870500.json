First, though, I will give you some small advice, if you are willing to lend an ear to it.\\n\\n'As you may already know, a Minstrel possesses a great power...the power to stir the spirit and raise hopes when all seems lost. When the spirit is roused, the body soon follows! A good Minstrel heals themselves and their fellows, staving off even the most dire wounds.\\n\\n'Demonstrate your mastery by entering combat with the training-dummy nearby, then using the skill <rgb=#00ff00>Major Ballad</rgb>.'\\n\\n\\nHINT:\\n\\nMinstrels use <rgb=#ffff00>Ballads</rgb> to attack their enemies, lightly heal their fellows and themselves. These skills operate on a rotating system that allows the minstrel to have three special buffs on themselves at any time. After the third buff is applied the next <rgb=#ffff00>Ballad</rgb> played will overwrite the first, then the second and so on.",
