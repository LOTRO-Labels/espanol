But this must suffice!\\n\\n'The city you see before us was once named Jaghân, the City of Gates, but with the passage of time the name gradually changed, becoming Zaghâna. When a great conflagration of unknown origin burned much of the old city to the ground, the ruling Ibili, or Elders, established the First Triumvirate, a Council of Three to govern the reborn city. They gave it the name Zajâna, City of Keys, to herald the dawning of a new era for the city of the scholars.\\n\\n'But Ordâkh hungered for land and treasure, and when that empire seized the city more than one hundred and twenty years ago, they changed its name again: now it was Jajân, a puppet fiefdom held beneath the Hûl's distant boot. Gladly, the story does not end there! Let us proceed to the gates and I will tell you what happened only last year, and continues to this day.'",

With so many of the soldiers of Ordâkh and Shagâna fighting away in the north during the last year, the people of Jajân rose against their oppressors. During this Scholars' Revolt, sometimes called the Second Blue Mutiny, they seized control of the western side of the city and pushed east until they were stopped by the remaining Ordâkhai garrison. Widespread fighting and ensuing fires split the city in twain, and it remains so today.\\n\\n'Now the free portion of the city is once again called Zajâna and it is ruled by a group of five: the Doorwards. The Ordâkh-controlled district of the city remains Jajân, and a new Triumvirate governs there. They believe this Second Blue Mutiny will end as did the first, crushed quickly by Ordâkh a hundred years ago, but as of yet it has not; the city remains divided.\\n\\n'Let us continue onward to the TBD.'",
