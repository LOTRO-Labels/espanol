Inside, you should seek out Lieutenant Ingi. He is a dwarf of great repute who has come to help us. He is handling the assault on one of Angmar's allies.\\n\\n'To reach Ost Ringdyr, travel north along the edge of the hills and outcroppings that lead towards the Misty Mountains. You will ride through a valley for a short time and emerge on a path guarded by our people. Be wary, the woods are teeming with the Enemy.'",
