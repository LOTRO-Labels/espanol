Sterkist speaks of you often, jealous that you have gone to the wide lands and he has not, but every day some of Grimbeorn's resolve that we stay at home diminishes somewhat.\\n\\nI am writing to you to tell you that word has reached us of a mighty bear, maddened with rage, rampaging through a forest in the Bree-land. It may be nothing, but I wonder if it is more than that. Could it be this creature is one of our kind: a skin-changer?\\n\\nIf so, we owe it to the people of the Bree-land to put an end to the threat of it. The traveller that brought us this word says there is a camp near an Old Forest threatened by this creature. Find someone at this Adso's Camp and do what you can!\\n\\nLanghár",
