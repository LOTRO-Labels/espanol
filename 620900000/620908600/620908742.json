Ides seeks to become as fearsome a combatant as her father, and has begun training as a shield-maiden. The youngest girls, Mildred and Áffa, reside at the mead-hall with their father.\\n\\n'Poor Emma passed away some years ago, before Athelward was able to sire a son. Her death sent Athelward into a long period of despair, but his mood has improved of late. He has begun eagerly searching for a new wife, with which to produce a male heir.'",
