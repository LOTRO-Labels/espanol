Now, a lesser man would fall into despair over this betrayal, if that is indeed what it is... but Ezôti is no lesser man, is he? The show must go on, as they say. To that end, I need you to find an egg-shaped rock, paint it to look like a roc's egg, and bring it back here. And no one needs to know!
