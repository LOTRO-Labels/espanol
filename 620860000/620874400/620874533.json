Simple, you say, but not so. I tried to gather them myself, but the colour didn't come out the same. Something the goblins must do changes the stone somehow.\\n\\n'If you can go to Bleakleaf Crest and collect several of the stones from the goblins for me, I would be grateful. I could make the most beautiful tea set you have ever seen.'",
