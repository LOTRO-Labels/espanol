At their points, they are as sharp as needles, and despite Turch's age, they show far less wear than those of the other boars in Cardolan. Perhaps Turch was so imposing that he did not often deign to fight his own battles, but judging by your encounter, this was not for lack of skill in combat.\\n\\nYou should bring this trophy to Gaerion, a trophy-hunter and lore-keeper of the Dúnedain of Cardolan.",
