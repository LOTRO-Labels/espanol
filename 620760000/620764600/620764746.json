They will continue to prey on us if we do not fight them. I ask you to enter this cave and to destroy this 'Morcheryn'. If she falls, then perhaps the others will leave Ram Dúath and return to whatever foul place in Angmar it is that spawned them.\\n\\n'These evil things have slain many of the Suuri-lehmä...
