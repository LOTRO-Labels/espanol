This I have done for years, every night, ever since I gave up the adventuring life. You may think it odd, but I have found these moonlit strolls to keep something of my old wanderlust at bay. \\qPerhaps this is the night I keep a-walking, Aberthol, old fellow?\\q I've asked myself on occasion, but thus far I have always come back to my home and sleep comes quickly.\\n\\n'But on that night, while strolling along the lane west of my home, smelling the night-flowers and listening to the sound of frogs down by the river-bank, I could sense that something was different. I can't tell you exactly what it might have been, but I was seized by a tremendous feeling of... I don't know... wrongness. I felt it in the pit of my stomach. There is a grassy place on the left between two buildings along that lane, and a single tree grows there. My eye was drawn to that tree, and as I watched I swear to you a deeper shadow moved out from behind the trunk.\\n\\n'It made a strange sound as it moved, a whispering just beyond the edge of my hearing. It reminded me of being lost in distant woods, stalked by a dangerous creature I could not yet see, but this was no mountain-lion. I drew on all my reserves of courage, I tell you, and I turned to run, but even as my muscles tensed I knew it was too late. While I stood transfixed by the creeping shadow in front of me, a second dark figure had come up behind. This one towered above me, for it sat astride a great black steed, but I could not tell you how I had not heard the sound of its hooves on the cobbles as it approached.\\n\\n'I must have fainted then, for the next thing I remember is being shaken awake by Bledri, one of the townspeople, carrying a lantern. He said he found me lying at the base of the tree between those two buildings on his way home, and with no sign of either dark figure anywhere about. But every night since, a terrible sensation of dread has fallen upon Herne as the sun disappears beneath the horizon.\\n\\n'Do you know what they were, friends? Has anything of this sort been seen in Gondor or in Rohan? What business could draw such terrible creatures to Herne?'",
