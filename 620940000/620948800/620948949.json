While in that place, Valacar met and fell in love with a woman of that people who bore him a son, Eldacar. In time, Valacar succeeded to the throne of Gondor.\\n\\n'Tensions began to grow in the southern reaches of the kingdom: what would happen when Valacar died and his son came to the throne? Eldacar did not possess purely Númenórean blood, but a lesser proportion due to his Northern mother. Eldacar did not sit the throne for long before much of Gondor erupted in open revolt.\\n\\n'A relative from a distant branch of the family line seized the throne: Castamir, the Usurper. The Men of Gondor fought among themselves. They were dark and bloody days.\\n\\n'Castamir was slain when, after ten years, Eldacar returned at the head of an army. Castamir's sons fled to Umbar, where they became the first of the Corsairs.'",
