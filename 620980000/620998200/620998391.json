Of this abyss, Lady Abrazaphel was granted a vision. It told of a hidden vault deep within the caverns of the Black Pits where Sauron kept the greatest of His artifacts and his secrets. We of the Order must uncover this vault, and we must learn what Sauron meant us to find. As He has promised, Sauron shall again be reborn, and the abyss of Mordath may hold the key to his return!\\nFor the glory of Sauron!\\n\\nHigh-priest Rabokhor",
