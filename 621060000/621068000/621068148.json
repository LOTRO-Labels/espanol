But because we completed those last two dares... don't argue with me, it still counts... then Dai has to fill his pockets with cheese and walk through Mossward.'\\n\\nYou ask the girl if she has considered that she might be the town bully after all, and she tips her head to one side, considering it.\\n\\n'Huh.
