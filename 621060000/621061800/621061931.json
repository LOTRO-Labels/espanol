      "en": "Originally an unofficial branch of the Watch, the Hobbits of the Yonder-watch have dedicated themselves to the preservation and protection of the wildest frontiers of the Shire. Traditionally led by the Reeves of Yondershire since the time of Bandobras 'Bullroarer' Took, they are now overseen by Rosalinda North-took of Long Cleeve. Although they count themselves among the few dwelling in the Shire to come into regular contact with the Rangers of the North and dabble in other curiosities, they remain faithful to their duty: patrolling the borders of the Shire, or as they prefer to say, 'beating the Bounds'.",
