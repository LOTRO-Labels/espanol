I collect pottery from the ruins of the kingdom of Arnor... well, to be honest, I purchase the pottery. It is a sign of my standing, and for years I have had a greater and higher quality collection than that dreadful Mirabella Underhill!\\n\\n'The man from whom I purchase the pottery is named Candac Brightwood. I haven't heard from him for a dreadfully long time and am worried about my next delivery. And about Mr. Brightwood's well-being, of course. I need someone to carry a letter to Candac at the Forsaken Inn. Look for the inn along the Great East Road, just past the Midgewater Marshes.\\n\\n'Mirabella will visit me soon, and if I have nothing new to show her, I will look a fool! You don't want that, do you?'",
