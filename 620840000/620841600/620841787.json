I am tasked with watching the events here in Bree-land and have learned that you have done much to assist the folk here. Your recent efforts in Bree-land came to my notice when I learned you aided a hobbit with a problem with Brigands.\\n\\nYour efforts against the brigands are admirable, and though you may have thought they were at an end, I regrettably must inform you that they are not yet finished. Bill Ferny, a citizen of Bree, in his own self-interest, endangers the lives of all the citizens of this land with his actions.\\n\\nIf you are willing, make the journey north along the Greenway to my cabin. You will find it east of Thornley's farm between Bree and the borders of the North Downs.\\n\\nSaeradan",
