They weave songs and tales so stirring that their companions' morale will not fail, and they will be driven to perform greater feats of prowess. They can even utter words of true power and ward against the forces of darkness with their Anthems.\\n\\nThis class was inspired by Lúthien Tinúviel, whose Elven voice beguiled friend and foe alike.</li>",
