In an effort to ensure that the threats posed by the nation in the past do not return, Prince Imrahil employs the service of spies and citizens embedded in the region during the reign of the Heirs of Castamir to track the efforts of Umbar's people. More importantly, the Order of the Eagle watches the Kindred and looks to contain them should they prove to be a threat to Gondor.",
