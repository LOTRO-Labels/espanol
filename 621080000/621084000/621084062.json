I had hoped I would have a new shanty to share with you, but despite our adventures, when I began to write, the words did not come to me.\\n\\n'After the rush of excitement wore off, all I felt was tired and worn out. The small cuts I earned from fighting that big crab sting, and my legs ache from dashing about the island. And then I thought, what if the sailor's life is not for me?\\n\\n'But then I thought of the freebooters we met, how welcoming and giving they were. I had expected them to be rough around the edges. Are my perceptions of life at sea shaped by tall tales and silly stories?\\n\\n'Have I been chasing a false ideal?\\n\\n'Thank you for travelling with me today and for keeping me safe. I did not get what I wanted out of today, but maybe that is all right.\\n\\n'May our paths cross again.'",
