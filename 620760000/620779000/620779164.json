When he was captured, he said a large Orc came over to torment him from a camp to the west from where he was being held, the one behind a wooden stockade. He says the other Orcs called this monster the Red Reaver. Robb says he must have his revenge on the Red Reaver and will be glad to give you what coins he can spare if you can put him to heel.\\n\\n'Now, I can't say as I like all this bloodshed, and it sounds right dangerous to me, but if you'll show that horrible monster who tortured Robb a thing or two, I guess you surely do deserve a reward.'",
