I know you are to be trusted, and that you will bring glory to the Trév Gállorg of Aughaire.\\n\\n'You have already ventured into the fortress of Tór Gailvin, north-east of this settlement, and taken the prizes of the Trév Duvárdain from them; the traitors will surely rue their loss, and question whether their loyalty was given too quickly to the savage rulers of this land. But their treachery runs deeper than greed, for a tribe of Orcs is quartered in the cave of Bûrzum Pushdug, just north of Tór Gailvin! The Trév Duvárdain have these Orcs for neighbours, and this is a treachery so low that even their greed cannot justify it!\\n\\n'Travel to Bûrzum Pushdug with an ally or two, and slay the Orcs there to remind the Trév Duvárdain what they would do were they worthy to walk the land of their fathers. The cave is on the west side of the hill on which Tór Gailvin is built, north-east of Aughaire.'",
