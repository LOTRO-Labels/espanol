They look a bit like crabs, but they are much larger. Their strange and bulbous eyes fill me with unease, I don't mind telling you. The Orcs call them 'Ukhrâsh.'\\n\\n'Well, I have had a thought, and that thought is this: perhaps we could use their shells to fashion useful articles for the war effort: shields, armour, who knows what else? But the shells of the small ones aren't thick enough to serve. Fret not! I have caught glimpses of a huge one! Only glimpses. I think it spends most of its time underwater, but I have a feeling that one's shell will be worth its weight in gold! I doubt you'll catch it out in the open, but perhaps you can lure it out with meat from the smaller uhkrâsh in the Pit of Stonejaws. I am hoping the big one is both scavenger and cannibal!'",
