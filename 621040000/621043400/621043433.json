Well, she was right that this is where the hobgoblins receive messages from elsewhere in Gundabad. Because of that, this camp has drawn the attention of spies, and I don't mean us! Ausma didn't specifically tell me not to do this so... I have an idea. You could do a lot of damage to the hobgoblins if you attack this camp, and because of the suspicion present on both sides, the warlord might assume it was the Orcs doing the backstabbing and not us dwarves! What do you say to that? Smart, eh?'",
