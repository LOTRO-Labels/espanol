Some of my kin have been looking to get the trade passing through the mountains again, and I'm doing my part to help.\\n\\n'The trouble is that the mountains are dangerous even in summer, and during winter only a fool would expect to come through without incident. And there are threats in the mountains beyond the cold and the snows -- goblins and worse!\\n\\n'There's an old keep far to the north, and evil Men have overtaken it for their own purposes. It's a ways north of the road, but I don't want any dwarves to get turned about in a storm and happen upon it unawares. I'd appreciate it if you could post this warning sign I've made in front of the slope leading up to the keep. There's already a suitable post at the base of the slope -- just affix the sign to it and hurry back. Head north along the road, and then turn north-west to travel into the northern source. It's quite a ways, so be prepared for a good hike!'",
