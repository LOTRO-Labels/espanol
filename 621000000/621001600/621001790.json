The earth, the water, even the air.\\n\\n'Allow me to introduce myself. I am Narthavron, master smith of the Noldor. I was present when the Last Alliance broke into this valley and defeated Sauron's army. I was filled with sorrow and anger seeing the atrocities they had committed here, and have made it my life's work to find a way to purge the corruption. I now believe I have the right tool to achieve this.\\n\\n'I have recovered one of the adamants of old, the Flame of Ancalamír. It will unravel many items throughout Middle-earth into different components that I have named \\qEmbers of Enchantment\\q, \\qFigments of Splendour\\q, and \\qMotes of Enchantment\\q. What do you think? I thought those names might help bring a little more light into this dark place. Anyway, after I break the objects down, I am then able to use some of those components to fashion extraordinary equipment. I have a feeling you will be instrumental in the Conquest of Gorgoroth, and as such will be encountering many of these special items in your travels. I have a proposition for you.\\n\\n'I will allow you use of the Flame. My assistants, the High-enchanters, will help you. You need only touch one of these objects to the Flame and it will be reduced to one of these components.  I believe that dwarf over there has been scavenging through the Orcs' forges. Perhaps he is willing to let go of something for this purpose. Find a piece of equipment, touch it to the Flame, and then return to me.'",
