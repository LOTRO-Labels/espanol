      "en": "Hello there, friend! Here is a brief primer to get you started in your travels as a Minstrel.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, your music will serve to bolster you and your allies in the fight against the Enemy.  Your songs bring great inspiration, restoring your morale and your fellows', and spur them to greater feats of valour. It will not be as simple as humming a few random bars, though.\\n\\n As you mature as a Minstrel, you will want to learn to string together ballads. To do so, simply play three ballads in a row. Once you have completed the third ballad, you can then play a coda to finish the piece.\\n\\nThere is much danger awaiting you; you cannot always just sing a happy tune and hope for the best. If you find yourself cornered and alone, you should consider changing your tone to something more...aggressive. War-speech changes many of your abilities to focus on your own survival rather than the survival of your fellows. In time of need, call upon War-speech to win the day.\\n\\nBeing an excellent Minstrel means knowing what songs, words, and actions are best in each situation. It is a life of nuance. Do not be afraid to experiment with your music. May your voice be strong, clear, and in pitch!\\n\\n-T.",
