I do not doubt the words of my men, and if these spirits are indeed who I believe them to be, there is a greater evil there that we have not yet perceived.\\n\\n'These wraiths must be the spirits of the four traitors that aided Angmar in the downfall of the Kings' Norbury. In the last stand against the Enemy, a great treachery occurred and the gates of the city were thrown down. Legend tells that the men were bewitched by the Witch-king's champion, a woman named Amarthiel. If these wraiths are indeed these men they must be dealt with.\\n\\n'I would ask that you visit Istuienn, who is learned in these matters. She may be able to assist you in finding some way of ending the threat of these new foes.'",

Alas that Laerdan is no longer with us, for he left many years ago with Golodir and no word has returned of them. He was a great lore-master and had long studied Fornost and Amarthiel.\\n\\n'Before its downfall, Amarthiel had entered Fornost under a false guise.  She appeared as a great smith, offering her skills against the works of the Enemy. Her words and council were heeded by many. She aided in the crafting of armaments and gear of war. Laerdan believed that before the downfall of the city, Amarthiel wielded a great power to sway the minds of Men. Four of the captains of the city-guard were enthralled by Amarthiel and taken into her service. When the Witch-king's horde pressed its final assault on Fornost, these men and their followers overthrew the door-wardens and opened the gates.\\n\\n'One account has been preserved from those who escaped. The ancient text of Laerdan gives the account of the last of the king's rear-guard to leave the city. The text claims the four men captive to Amarthiel's will swore an oath to her upon morgul-blades, pledging their unending service and then threw themselves upon the swords. If the wraiths have returned to fulfil their oath, Halbarad is right to fear. I would ask you to gather companions and seek the wraiths in the ruins of Fornost. If you can, recover the hilts of the morgul-blades. I am sure that they would still possess them and guard them fiercely. If the account is true, then the blade-hilts bind these wraiths to Middle-earth, and their destruction may bring about an end to their evil.'",
