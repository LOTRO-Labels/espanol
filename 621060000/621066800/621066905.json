The one exception: children of Mossward are particularly interested in the dangers that lurk just beneath the surface of the marshes, and scouts of Lhan Garan have had to rescue wayward children and send them back home. The Dunlendings have found this a more entertaining occurrence than have the people of Mossward.",
