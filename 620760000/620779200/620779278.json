The town has had to deal with minor threats from the Blackwolds, as you expected, but a more suprising threat was discovered in the marshes: goblins. Fortunately, thanks to the efforts of the bearer of this note, the town is safe from these vile beasts. The goblins appear to have been led by two chieftains, Gurzst√¢z and Gurzrum. These creatures though were defeated, and without their leadership, the remaining goblins are now scattering to the far corners of the marsh.\\n\\nAt your service,\\n\\nGuard Redweed",
