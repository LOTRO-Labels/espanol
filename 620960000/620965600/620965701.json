I have here but one Éored, but it is composed of the fiercest warriors in all of Rohan, I stake my honour upon it! We have been through much to come so to this company.\\n\\n'We received the call to the weapontake on the night of March 11th, and I began to gather what men I could: two Éoreds of Wildermore's most skilled riders. At dawn, I led these men east to the Wold, but I did not know that danger was so near: under cover of darkness, Orcs and Easterlings had crossed the river at the Undeeps. They overwhelmed the watchers at Stangard and crossed into the Wold.\\n\\n'The Enemy assailed Harwick, but Aldor Harding had already gone to the weapontake. His son Léodwig remained in the city, and saw that all would soon be lost. That is when my Éoreds charged right into the flank of the Enemy! Our fortunes did not hold, and we were soon routed. The city was now afire. Léodwig rode forth and fought valiantly, but he was grievously wounded. We withdrew to a defensible position on a hilltop; it was to be the location of our last stand.\\n\\n'Early in the morning on March 12th, as the Enemy prepared to climb the hill and put an end to us, one of our scouts reported hearing a sighing sound on the wind. It was the rustling of branches, thousands of them, and it rushed down from Wildermore in a great flood of sound.\\n\\n'Behind this great sound came the trees, dozens of trees in every variety, and among them strode great shepherds. At first I thought these were devils of Núrzum's kind, but it was not so. They were led by a strange fellow by the name of Leaflock, and he spoke in halting fashion of many unfathomable mysteries, some of which I have still not unravelled. There will be time for determining the meaning behind his words later, if we survive the war ahead. He did not consider himself or his people warriors, but I can tell you they became terror on the battlefield. The Enemy will not come back to the Wold.\\n\\n'There was only one Éored left to me after this battle. We rode with haste to the Entwade and changed horses. We passed Aldburg at dusk but did not stop. Upon reaching Beaconwatch we had to stop and rest, and learned there that Théoden camped in the Firien Wood the night before!\\n\\n'At dawn on the 13th, with our horses refreshed, we crossed the Mering-stream and rode hard through the Beacon Hills. We were so close, but not yet close enough: we were beset by Orcs and Variags near Amon Dîn. We broke through the line of Variags, but they did not pursue us. I think now I know the reason: they knew the road ahead would be held against us.\\n\\n'In the darkness of night, we came to the western flank of the encampment in the Drúadan, and were nearly turned into pincushions by Grimbold's sentries! At the last moment, one of the archers recognized me by the spectre of my beard, crimson in the guttering light of the single torch they allowed! Can you imagine what Cyneberg would say if this great tale of mine, of riding more than five hundred miles in three days to the aid of my King, ended with me and my men put in the ground by our own sworn-brothers? I can imagine what she would say, and it makes my head hurt more than any of Núrzum's tantrums!\\n\\n'That is the tale, [placeholder]. We have ridden hard, and through battle, to stand with Théoden King. Onward to triumph and glory! I have spoken already with Harding, and given him news of his son, but you should speak to him also. He is in the north-eastern reaches of the encampment.'",

But it is not certain we will do so, for there is some trouble ahead in the road.'\\n\\nYou tell Harding that you spoke with Thrymm about his journey from Wildermore.\\n\\n'Then you must have heard that my son Léodwig led the defence of Harwick against the creeping Orcs and Easterlings? My heart swelled to hear the Red-beard speak of my son's charge from the city! He will bear his wounds proudly, and if my own road is to end in the battles to come, I will know that the Wold is in capable hands. I did not think my boy would have the ability to lead men in battle; indeed, I sent him to investigate Wildermore in part because I thought he could not handle the dangers pressing from the east.\\n\\n'But I am pleased to have been wrong. Sons have a way of growing up and becoming men, I suppose. Speak to Ingbert of Entwash Vale if you doubt me! He told me that his own son, Horn, has experienced a similar transformation!\\n\\n'Ingbert's tents are to the west of here.'",
