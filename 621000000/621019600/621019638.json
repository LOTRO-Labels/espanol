I am low on two items in particular: reeds and moss from the nearby river-bank. The reeds can be dried and woven into baskets and mats. The moss can be soaked in medicine and applied to wounds. If you could gather some of both, I would be very appreciative! You can get to the river quickly by taking the path east through the hills. Perhaps the fishermen at the docks could also use your help.'",
