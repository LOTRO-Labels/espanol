I will not regale you with tales of my many accomplishments, but if you are not careful I fear my companions might!\\n\\n'Isteron was always very impressed with my stories of the lands to the distant east. Great beasts and dangerous birds can be found there, and I have hunted them all! Rodwen might speak of my prowess in the south-lands. Do you know those mighty four-legged monstrosities, the great mûmakil?'\\n\\nCúfaron quickly shakes his head as you ask if he hunted one of those.\\n\\n'Nay, not as such...but I saw one. In the distance, but still, you have not seen one, have you?'\\n\\nThe hunter regains his composure.\\n\\n'There are a lot of vile dogs around the East Wall, and I do not think they are creatures of nature. The Rohirrim call them swert-hounds, and they seem to me to be quite evil. You should hunt them, as I plan to do. I think they could cause trouble for us if they get too near to our camp.'",

It is true that you almost bested me. I know it is not a competition, but it is still nice to know the score.\\n\\n'These creatures are not natural, that much seems certain. Their evil is evident. They were drawn here by something, but I know not what. We should not stay here. The sooner my friends and I can be gone from this place, the better! But I will, of course, continue to hunt the deadliest of creatures for as long as we remain in the East Wall, and you should strive to match me in this, if you can.'",
