We know the All-seeing are constructing great siege engines. We believe it is with intention to destroy Urmâkh. We have intercepted several of their spies around the perimeter of Urmâkh, scouting our defences. I need you to go back to Kûr Anzar and destroy these weapons whilst they are still being built. There is often black powder stored around these great weapons. Set it ablaze and then quickly make your escape. The resulting conflagration should do the rest.'",
