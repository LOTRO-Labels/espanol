They are being attacked by Corsairs while delivering food and supplies to our settlements on the Cape of Umbar. We believe these attacks are coordinated by a Corsair captain, Ghasaphâr, who makes his camp in Kan Skûrja on the Cape of Umbar. Please, go there and root out these Corsairs, so that our merchant vessels can once again pass safely into and out of the Cape. Defeat Ghasaphâr and the scoundrels who follow him.'",
