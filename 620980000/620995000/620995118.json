It came from elsewhere, and the corruption that envelops it stems from its long stay in the Black Land. If this evil could be cleansed, I believe that Elrond could imbue it with a powerful and vital force for Good.\\n\\n'Before that can happen, however, we must do something about the corruption that Mordor has worked upon it. There are different methods to accomplish this, though the Wise disagree upon the effectiveness of each. My preferred means for such a cure is to bring the corrupted item to the place where it was made, or to places of some significance upon its path, and to thereby diffuse the foul touch of Mordor that has, in the interim, claimed it. We must learn the story of this heirloom before it came to Mordor.'\\n\\nThe Wizard turns the artifact over in his hands, studying it for some clue to its origin. To your eye the heirloom is a small sculpture carved from stone, in the shape of a squat humanoid figure.\\n\\n'This carving is very similar in shape to the Púkel-men that guard the road to Dunharrow, in Rohan, but I have never seen one carved so small. It is said that those figures are carved in the likenesses of the Drúedain, the Woses, the Wild Men, and the forest in Taur Drúadan is home to similar statues of enormous size.\\n\\n'If this is so, perhaps the Woses will be able to tell you from where this sculpture came, and aid in the cleansing of its evil.
