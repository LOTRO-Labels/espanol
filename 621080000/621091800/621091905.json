'We really should get him a cat. Unfortunately, dark times lie ahead for us Morutágya. Tumúldo was our leader by right of birth, but he was also a great hero to our people and was well-loved. We would have readily followed Nakási, but she seems to have abandoned us for that khmêg Azagath.\\n\\nYou can see on his face that Nakási's flight weighs heavy upon his heart.\\n\\n'They have a child, Umisúm, who would now be our leader by right of birth, but she will not go unchallenged. She is in her teen years and has yet to prove herself to our people. I hope for her sake that she is as cunning as her father and as fierce as her mother or she may not make it to adulthood. You know how families are.\\n\\n'I wanted to thank you for bringing us the letter from that ugly Gondorian. It is better to know than to be left wondering. There are difficult times ahead for all Morutágya, but we have survived worse. Now go. Leave these sewers and visit the baths. You stink.'\\n\\nHe waves you off and you are clearly being dismissed.",
