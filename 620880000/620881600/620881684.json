I was taking this caravan to Avardin for the upcoming auction when I was beset by the Dragon-clan. They are an evil lot, and I suspect they answer to Isengard. Saruman is not the friend that he claims to be. There are few who can see through his tangled web of lies, and my clan, the People of the Ox, least of all, it seems. I seek to change that, but to do so, I must be in a position of power. Among the Ox-clan merchants that means money, which I had hoped to raise at the coming auction.\\n\\n'Please, I ask your help. I have not yet had time to assess the damage to my caravan. If you could check my cart and goods, then venture out against the raiders, I would be grateful. They came from the hill to the east.'",
