I must ask, sir, whether you believe these Blackwold villains will stop their attacks of their own accord? For it seems to me (and I am by no means an expert on the subject, though I must confess a certain professional interest compels me to inquire in this regard) that you have done very little to safe-guard the property of the people of Staddle. I have observed (on no fewer than two occasions) dark shapes lurking about my pipe-weed field, and investigation the next day revealed to me the loss of several of the ripest plants!\\n\\nThere are brigands lurking in these parts, Constable Bolger, and if you are unable to retrieve my stolen pipe-weed from their overlarge and undeserving hands, I shall consult with Mr. Redweed, Mr. Foxglove, and Ms. Tanglerush, who I believe will surely give me the satisfaction of my returned pipe-weed. These watchers of Bree may be Big Folk, but they are a Good Sort, and I will turn to them next if you are unable to provide satisfaction.\\n\\nI bid you good day, Constable.\\n\\nMr. Himloc Grouse",
