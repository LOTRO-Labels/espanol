I say it is an honour and one well-deserved, no matter what some others in the Vale might think of the new King of Gondor. A fine honour, indeed!\\n\\n'I'm afraid there isn't much trouble about at Sardolâ€”at least not like there was during the War. I've heard that some of the Corsairs and some deserters have made their way to Tarlang's Crown, but it'll come to nothing, I think. \\n\\n'It may not be much, but I could use a little help today, if you can spare the time in the course of your errands for King Elessar.
