We had long debated the existence of the famed tower of Durin that some say sits atop Zirakzigil. I did not believe Thorlák when he said he would find it or perish in the attempt, but now I fear for his life!\\n\\n'Four days ago, he left camp in search of Durin's Tower, and he has not been seen since. If you could journey into the Redhorn Gate and search for any sign of him, I would be much in your debt. I last saw Thorlák heading into the snow near to the mountains.'",
