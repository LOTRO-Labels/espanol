They knew they were leaving, but they wanted to safe-guard as many of their treasures as possible. The locks came on a separate ship that arrived safely. The keys never made it. They still swapped the locks out, believing it was safer that no one could get in. One of the doors locked was to the cellar of the lighthouse itself. We need to get inside urgently, for an evil has made its den there.\\n\\n'This page gives the location of the wreck that should contain those keys. Search the waters and bring back whatever containers you can find.'",
