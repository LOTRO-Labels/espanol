To catch one, you must first defeat a goat, then while the kill is fresh, jump into the waters. If you are quick enough, the blood-fish can then be caught. The scent will dissipate soon thereafter, so you must be quick about it.\\n\\n'The goats and blood-fish can be found among the willows along a section of the Entwash south-west of Walstow.
