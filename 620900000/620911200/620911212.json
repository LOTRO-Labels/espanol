I think the Reeve too brash for his own good... he is sooner to get himself killed than to address the needs of his people. Nonetheless, the Orcs are to blame for our predicament. To the west and south, they have essentially blocked all contact between Walstow and Snowbourn, and until these Orcs are brought to heel, our situation can only worsen.'",
