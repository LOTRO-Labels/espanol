It seems too that his fate is interwoven with yours, for even the tale of Vóin is not free of his corruptive touch, though it be written almost a thousand years ago. Gothmog has been a long-simmering font of evil; he can no longer remain unchallenged. It is time at last to put an end to him.\\n\\n'These past few years revealed to us that which we did not know: King Eärnur was not slain when he rode to Minas Morgul to confront the Witch-king; he was instead transformed into Mordirith, a thrall of the Lord of the Nazgûl. It was by Mordirith's hand that the shadow fell upon Angmar, but he was opposed by Golodir the Ranger and Narmeleth of Lindon, to say nothing of a certain [placeholder] of my acquaintance. Mordirith's designs were broken, but his spirit persevered and he was given a new guise, and a new task. He would command Sauron's armies in war, second only to his old master, the Witch-king of Angmar.\\n\\n'But the Witch-king was slain at Pelennor, as few only might have dared hope, and Gothmog's confidence in his own invulnerability was shaken. He fled the field, escaping to Imlad Morgul and sealing the roads in or out of that vale. While Sauron thrived, the Free Peoples of Middle-earth had worries enough to occupy their attention, and Gothmog could be set aside. But now a new fear presents itself to me. Gothmog has had time now to lick his wounds and search the valley for artifacts that might reverse his fortunes. What terrible sorceries might he have discovered?'",
