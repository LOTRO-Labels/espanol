Dark places are everywhere, [placeholder], including the hearts of Men, Elves, dwarves, and hobbits alike.\\n\\n'Darkness prevails especially in times such as these, where doom seems inevitable. You have seen the Orcs prowling as sure as Men walk, and wights leaving their barrows to trouble the fields upon which they fell, and Warg-voices rending the stillness of a quiet night. \\n\\n'My thoughts often turn to a dear old friend in Bree-town who goes by the name of Erling Goodbody. He has suffered much hardship of late, and my songs used to cheer him. I have such a song here; but I'm afraid I don't have time to make the journey.  Do you think you could go and play this song for him in my stead, [placeholder]?  \\n\\n'Erling usually spends his days in the thoroughfare in front of the Prancing Pony.  Find him and play him a song to raise his spirits.  When you have done this, please return to me, for I wish to hear tidings of my friend.'\\n",
