Why, I've even heard tale of one who would eat the fish right off the hook while you were trying to reel it in. Would wait for you to do all the hard work and then swoop in at the end and steal your dinner.\\n\\n'They're also dangerous creatures, with jaws that can snap a man's leg clear in half. I love just about everything in the water, even some of the things from the true depths, but turtles we cannot tolerate any longer.\\n\\n'Head to the swamps north of Calembel, to the north-east of here, and spend some time fishing. When you get a turtle on the line, pull hard and make sure that it comes ashore. When it does, take care of it. There are a lot of them out there in the shallows, so make sure you clear out a couple.'",
