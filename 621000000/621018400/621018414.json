Haerandel and I walked together among these flowers, in kingdoms North and South, and our eyes lighted on the horizon and our minds danced upon the future it promised. I am brought back to those happy days, and the sorrows that followed in the wake of Sauron and his wars are forgotten to me. The promise of the sun-flowers was as bright as their petals, and so many journeys lay still ahead of us.\\n\\n'Following the death of Anárion and the decline of Arnor, the Anarlossë died out in the wider world. And yet, somehow, a seedling must have come to this land. I can see it in my mind's eye, [placeholder], borne aloft in springtime, carried on the breeze, until it came to rest within this sheltered land. That seed took root, and from it the line prospered, hidden from outside eyes. The Anarlossë survived.'\\n\\nEdlothon gazes at the sun-flowers in silence.\\n\\n'I was prepared to depart. My heart wept to leave my brother, but I knew I would see him again when he too sailed from these shores. But the sight of these flowers has restored in me a sensation I have not felt since our travels together, so long ago. How many other wonders might remain in Middle-earth? The wanderlust stirs in me again.\\n\\n'I believed I could remain no longer, but now I think my brother and I might find joy in another journey within the bounds of Middle-earth, and then depart for the Undying Lands together, as once I thought we would. Can I ask you to convey this message to Haerandel for me? I will spend some time here in contemplation, and will join him soon.\\n\\n'You have my thanks, [placeholder], for reminding me of what I once held dear. And not only that! I am grateful for one more thing: you have given back to me the hope of the unexpected, the unlooked-for wonders that might still remain around the next bend, or behind the next tree.

I would not tell him otherwise, and I did not wish to make him stay.\\n\\n'But when you went in search of him, when it seemed the Anarlossë might bloom still somewhere in the Shire, I confess I did wonder what I would say if he chose to stay.
