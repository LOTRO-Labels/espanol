I spoke to you of Azog, who led the Orcs against us during the Great Orc War, and perished beneath Dáin's heel at Azanulbizar? A son he had, Bolg, who commanded the Orcs at the Battle of Five Armies. Bolg died before the Lonely Mountain, but his line did not end there. Two were the sons of Bolg. One was named Gorgar, and if the words of Natsatúg can be trusted he calls himself now the Lord of Gundabad.\\n\\n'Bolg's other son was Mazog, [placeholder], the same Mazog who was slain by my old companion Bofur's grandson Broín, wielding the mithril axe Zigilburk. This new Lord of Gundabad possesses no shortage of grievance against the dwarves, but the death of his brother Mazog can only fuel that most powerful of desires: a thirst for blood, and vengeance.'",
