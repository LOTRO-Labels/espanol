It seems the only place here in Bree where people would even think about heading up to is the old Barrow-downs. Well, there I go talking before explaining. You see, I am quite interested in the place -- the Barrow-downs that is. Ancient cities, old kings, and treasure beyond imagining! My dad, Newbold, has told me such wonderful stories. It seems somehow he got quite a few pieces of old histories out of the Downs, though he never would tell me how.\\n\\n'I have tasked every hunter who frequents this lodge to travel to the Barrow-downs and retrieve some of the Barrow-treasure, but it seems that none of them have the nerve. As for those Rangers, they aren't ones to be pushed, if you get my meaning. I have heard talk that the treasures within the underground barrows are some of the finest. One of the hunters goes on and on about removing the treasure and breaking some curse laid on it... all a bunch of nonsense if you ask me.  \\n\\n'If you would travel to the Barrow-downs, venture into the underground barrows and retrieve some of the old Barrow-treasures, you would be held in high regard, I'm sure.'",
