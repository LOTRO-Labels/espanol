I hope that is acceptable to you.'\\n\\nYou now judge Enid of honourable character and relinquish the information you have been holding close about the less than reputable actions of Nye Crowfoot and Addy Rushtuft as well as the hidden tomb of Arnor.\\n\\n'I see. I have had my suspicions about those two but did not have any proof to expel them from the League. I have been sending you on expeditions with them to monitor their actions in the Wildwood. I knew I judged your character as true and could trust you. We must now keep an even closer eye on Nye and Addy. Now as for this hidden tomb, the League of the Axe is not comprised of tomb-robbers. I have no interest in an old tomb. If we work in the mines however, we will proudly protect and preserve the tomb.'",
