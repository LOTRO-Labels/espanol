It is another thing entirely to fight a beast that is twice as large as you, three times as heavy, and cares not for how good your form is. You cannot intimidate it with fancy bladework, nor trick it, not unless you possess some sorcery of which I am unaware.'\\n\\nA woman in tattered armour and threadbare boots shakes her head. 'Just me and my blade. No special tricks here.'\\n\\nGrey Cloak inclines her head towards a particularly nasty looking creature. 'I believe that is the strongest of them here. Do you think you can take it down?'\\n\\nThreadbare Boots grins and slashes through the air a few times, warming up her wrist. 'After watching you, I think I know just what to do.'",
