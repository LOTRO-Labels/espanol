Alas, it is true that since rumours of dark tidings have come out of the East, so too have a great many men of shall we say... questionable repute? No doubt you've come across a few of them already.\\n\\nBut from what I hear you have taken up the cause of some number of the people of North Downs of late, and for that I commend you. Dark times such as these call for folk of action and bravery to stand forth!\\n\\nI will be keeping an eye on you [placeholder], for I suspect that there is a tale to your deeds that shall soon be told.'",
