It was many years before I walked these hills again, and my friends among the Stôrs eased those hurts somewhat, but they did not long stay here. When they departed I did too, and wished not to return. Only the wish of Elrond or his sons could bring me back to Mitheithel, and so it was. I found no sign of the black riders they sought, but I did befriend Maddoc and Glenys Stagshorn, and that friendship was a bright memory unlike those I have of Sauron's war upon the Elves. I hope I have not damaged its foundation!\\n\\n'But that has given me an idea, [placeholder]. The Stagshorns have lived in the Angle for most of their years, but they have not the long lives of the Eldar. This has always been a land of beauty for them, unmarred by the memory of war. I will give to them a gift, a painted landscape of Mitheithel, and that will repair the hurts done by our quarrel!\\n\\n'I have not forgotten the lessons of Wenna, the painterly Stôr I once knew in Glynafon. We will fashion the pigments I need from natural materials found throughout Mitheithel, and so will the painting be made of the landscape it represents! This is going to work, [placeholder]. Can I ask you to help me collect the soft stones I will need to make these paints? You will find them alongside river-banks throughout the Angle. I will meet you outside Thelgarth when we have enough, for I believe from that high place I will find a vista worth painting!'",
