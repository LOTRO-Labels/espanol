      "en": "Twenty-eighth of October\\nThey're all dead. The lads. I had a terrible nightmare that they were crying out in pain, and awoke to find their bodies strewn about the caverns like boughs after a storm. Blood everywhere. I don't know what happened. Last night was just like every other night — I put the necklace on and slept in the corner with one eye on the door, just to be sure. I don't understand. It doesn't make sense. Who killed them?\\n\\nSix of Novembre\\nI've buried them all. I had to. The way they looked at me with their cold, dead eyes … it's as if they BLAMED me. But I didn't do it! I would remember if I did. Wouldn't I? No … they must have carved each other up squabbling over who would get the necklace – after they TOOK it from me! Well, I'm GLAD they're dead. Now at least my precious jewel will be safe!\\n\\nTwelveth Novembre\\nFlashes. Memories? I see myself, holding an axe. The faces of my crew … horrified, then broken. Blood, blood. The necklace … pulsing, pounding at my chest. It made me do it. IT MADE ME. But I love it any way. No one can change that.\\n\\nNine\\nI miss them. I do. It's so lonely here. Just me and my thoughts. And my pretty necklace. I do love it, I do. It doesn't judge me. It is my one companion and friend. It would never lead me astray.",
