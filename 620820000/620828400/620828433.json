Now half-orcs have come to Barad Morlas and threaten to despoil our memorials.\\n\\n'I ask that you go to Barad Morlas to the south-west and recover as many of the memorial statues as you can. While you are there, look also for a strange Orc who goes by the name of Shatogtar; defeat him, for it is he who commands the destruction of those things we hold dear.'",
