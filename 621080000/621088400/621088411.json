That is why I keep a close watch on anything that seems out of the ordinary, and why my neighbours believe I have been taken by madness. But it is not so!\\n\\n'Why, just this afternoon I have learned that Corsairs have left parcels along the waterway that runs through the Lower Ward... this one right here! They must be stockpiling weapons so they can begin another rebellion, as they did before. The Sea-stone Mutiny began in the Lower Ward... who is to say these Corsairs do not intend to foment another uprising? This one would aim to overthrow the Kindred of the Coins!\\n\\n'We cannot allow that to happen! Find the parcels these Corsairs have hidden along the waterway and return them to me so we may stop their plans before they get any further along!'",
