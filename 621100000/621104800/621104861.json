It tells of an enchanted tree where people gather from miles around, and beneath its boughs, they dance, drink, and feast. \\qThe Party Tree\\q, they call it. A rather plain name, I should say, but at least it is descriptive.\\n\\n'My friend, I charge you with a quest. A quest unlike any other. Go forth and search every corner of Middle-earth until you find this \\qParty Tree\\q. When you find it... if you find it, see if you can convince one of the revellers to accept an invitation to join us here at Zír Aktar. Mind that you do not bother too many people who would not be open to such a journey, or people will think you a pest and grow to have a poor opinion of us.'\\n\\n<rgb=#FF0000>NOTE: This quest will be removed from your quest log when the current festival ends.</rgb>",
