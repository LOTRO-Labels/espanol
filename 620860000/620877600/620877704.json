Taking that flag and returning it to the first landing of Tol Ascarnen will grant a buff to all defenders within Tol Ascarnen. This buff will persist until the flag is returned to the camp.\\n\\n<rgb=#FF00FF00>Artifacts:</rgb>\\nThere are Artifacts at Ost Ringdyr and DÃ¢r-gazag protected by keep lords. Once the keep lord is defeated, the artifact may be taken and carried to the Artifact Room within your faction's keep. To capture the opposition's artifact, you must have control of your own faction's artifact.\\n\\nCapturing artifacts rewards the controlling faction with buffs, only useable within the Ettenmoors.'",
