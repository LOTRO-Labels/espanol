My wife said the number might as well have been zero after she tried the pillow I made from them. \\qBevan, you fool!\\q she said to me, \\qIt takes more than eight feathers to make a pillow, and anyone who tries it with craban feathers, of all things, deserves the crimp it would leave in his neck!\\q\\n\\n'I suppose the good ideas that spring up in autumn... well, they fall when winter comes. I'd rather deal with the threat of Uruk war-bands loose in the Swanfleet than present my wife with another one of my brand-new ideas!
