The residents did not stand a chance against its fearsome might, while some were crushed beneath buildings, many were swept away by the river that now swiftly flows through its centre. Within a moment of the tragedy striking, they were all gone. There is nothing we can do for them now, but they may still be able to aid us. The town was known for its pitch, a thick, black, sticky substance that can seal a leak on a boat or burn for an entire night. They stored it in vases that may still be intact.'",
