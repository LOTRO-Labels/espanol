He said to me in this letter that he was in need of a large supply of oats, the largest order I have ever seen, to be sure.  \\n\\n'I didn't much take a liking to the idea right away, but what with the hard times and all, well now I couldn't turn down his offer, even if I don't take too kindly to the name of Sackville-Baggins; leastwise, the Baggins part of it. Queer tales, to be sure, are told about that family.  \\n\\n'If you have the time, I could use more hands to collect the oats from the fields east and north-east of here. I would get out there myself, but with all those nasty bugs... well, pardon my saying it, but your clothes look more to the task what with being dressed for fighting and all.'",
