I like it.\\nWe decided on our own, and then together, we are bound to fight for something beyond the freedom of Shagâna. We came to this decision because of you.\\nYou aided me without expectation of compensation. You allowed me to pursue Ashâmi and shared wholesome advice along the journey. You listened to me. You listened and shared.\\nYou helped Ashâmi in the same manner, selflessly.\\nWe both realize, though our cultures are strange to one another, we are more alike than we are different.\\nWe each appreciate each other, our pasts, and, more importantly, our future. We have pledged to be together, whatever fate plans.\\nWe found our future and our love because fate placed you in our path.\\nKismet.\\nYou are eternally our friend.\\nRaphûz and Ashâmi",
