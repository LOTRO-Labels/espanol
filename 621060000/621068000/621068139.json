The portion of it we know begins at Tharbad, and although the road itself is broken in places and obscured by foliage, it runs through Swanfleet and passes on into Enedwaith. From there it enters Dunland, leads through the Gap of Rohan, and continues on into Gondor. They say it passes Minas Tirith and eventually ends at a port-city along the coast, although I have never journeyed in that land.\\n\\n'North of Tharbad the road has another name. It is called the Greenway, and only Meneldir's people are like to remember when it and our own Old South Road were one and the same: the North-South Road between the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor. That was long ago, even by their reckoning.'",
