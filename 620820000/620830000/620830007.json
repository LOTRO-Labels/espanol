Deciding if the column will hold the ceiling is often a harder job than carving and sculpting the column itself.\\n\\n'I call this to your attention because you have found Khibir-zamu, one of the few undisturbed tombs remaining in Khazad-d没m. Within its walls are buried some of the finest minds these depths have ever seen. Those who had the talent and the ability to envision these halls and shape their making.\\n\\n'Head south-west and enter Khibir-zamu. Within, you should find several expensive looking containers throughout the tomb. Those do not hold mithril or jewels, but rather documents and maps, the key to how the vision became real. Bring them back to me here. You may wish to bring an ally or two, for while the tombs are undisturbed, a pack of deep-claws has made its home within.'",
