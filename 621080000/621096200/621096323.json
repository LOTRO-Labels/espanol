But that can wait for happier times, friend.\\n\\n'I have an urgent matter with which I'd ask your help. Scouts of the All-seeing have been pressing closer and closer to Urmâkh. We captured five this week alone. Regrettably, we missed a raiding party this morning. They made off with several innocent residents of Urmâkh, no doubt to torture them for information on our plans and defences.\\n\\n'You have proven quite resourceful in accomplishing much for Hamât, and Mizâdi. She has placed her trust in you multiple times, and you haven't let her down. I've been watching you quite closely, friend. This is a mission of great import. I believe you are skilled enough to accomplish what few others could. Please, go to Kûr Anzar, find where they have taken those Urmâkhi citizens, free them, and defeat any Barkhûshim that get in your way. You are the best hope those people have to return safely to Urmâkh, so please, go quickly.'",
