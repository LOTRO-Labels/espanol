      "en": "Prince Durin marshals his troops for battle, and the War of Three Peaks begins! The fighting ebbs and flows as the Orcs mount a ferocious defence, but early successes on the part of the Gabil'akkâ are not enough to secure outright victory. Tensions flare between the various dwarf-clans, despite their common enemy, and arguments between Longbeard, Zhélruka, and Stout-axe threaten to undermine the war effort. At last Durin marches for the gates of Gundabad to face Gorgar in combat, but just as victory seems assured a terrible roar sounds from the heights: Hrímil Frost-heart has broken free of her icy prison behind the Anvil of Winterstith, and she claims lordship of Gundabad. Durin sounds the retreat, but he vows not to relinquish the Mountain-home to this new intruder, or any other.\\n\\nThe next chapter will begin with Prince Durin, located either in Zarkul-sulûn during the War of Three Peaks or in Annâk-khurfu in Elderslade.",
