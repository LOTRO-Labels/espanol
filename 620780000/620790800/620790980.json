He blames himself for Angmar discovering their location as they seem to have lived here for generations beneath everyone's notice, even the trolls.\\n\\n'Since his discovery, the Uruk-warleaders have ordered continuous assaults against the village, and the hobbits there, resilient and proud, have taken up arms to defend their homes. Mayor Wat Mudbottom leads them and has asked for little help. He sent a single emissary, Pip Diggins, to Ost Ringdyr to entreat with Lainedhel and has received weapons and arms from us in return for food that he and his people grow and hunt.\\n\\n'Please, if you can, visit Mayor Wat Mudbottom and assist him however you may.'",

Most are smarter than a troll, and though wolves have always been a bother, the wolves that have come now are much more frightening. We're concerned with the spiders too, but only because their webs are awfully hard to pull from the hair on our feet.\\n\\n'No doubt you have come to help, and we are grateful, truly we are. Emerald, along the road to the south and east, might need some help, if you ask her. Ned over at the store-house, just over this rise behind me and down to the water's edge, can always use a hand. And at the crest of the hill, north a bit, you will find Marigold. See if they might need anything, would you?'",
