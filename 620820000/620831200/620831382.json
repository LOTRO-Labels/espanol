Word of your valour and courage has reached my ears, but seeing as I am a disbelieving sort, I would like to see if you are made for the sort of challenge I have to offer you. \\n\\n'Many of us are hoping to thwart the Orcs from their evil intentions to attack the Golden Wood of the Elves. If you are truly all that they say you are, you will go and face the leader that stands at the heart of Fil Gashan; his name is General Talug. I want you to defeat this Orc and bring me his ring as proof that he is dead.\\n\\n'This will not be an easy task, nor is it impossible. Prove yourself in this challenge of mine, and you will receive a rich reward. Oh, and...there is no shame in bringing friends with you on this venture.'",
