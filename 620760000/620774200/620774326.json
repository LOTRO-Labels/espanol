Forgive my presumption, but I have heard tale of your wanderings across the realm of Arnor in recent months, and in particular of your adventures here within the Trollshaws. Ah, it has been over an age of the world since I wandered such as you do. Now only one last trek remains before me, but for you and your kin who remain within Middle Earth, such an array of experience yet awaits you. Ah! that I should feel the bite of envy even after all these years, and yet I do, you know.\\n\\nAll the darkness that lies before you, it is naught but a veil drawn across the future, waiting to be torn aside by those who possess the valor and insight to do so. So it has been in each age past, and so it shall be now and again - at least, that is my thought on the matter.\\n\\nBut do not let my words make light of the trials you face, for Middle Earth has felt the yoke of darkness before, and long and heavily has it lain upon the land awaiting those with the strength to lift it. You have come far young one - do not falter now.'",
