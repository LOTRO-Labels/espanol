From there we can govern passage into Ambarûl from the east by the waterway, and from the south through Khûd Zagin. The Ordâkhai have been contesting us for control of the Wrackwade, but there have only been small daily skirmishes so far.\\n\\n'I suspect the Ordâkhai have decided that if they cannot control the Wrackwade, then nobody can. I think those waggons are for destroying our makeshift bridge there. We will be completely cut off from the rest of Shâgana if they succeed. We cannot allow this to happen!\\n\\n'Please, if you think you are able, return to Eshadûr and destroy that black powder! After you have done this, you should go to the Wrackwade and inform the Dumûri captain there, Ningêna, of what has occurred. If you feel you are capable of helping her further, please do so. She is the widow of my son, Tâlax, and is truly like a dumûri; a daughter, to me.'",
