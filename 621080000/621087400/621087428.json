I appreciate what you did here for Khûtra's animals, so I know you understand how important our duty is, to protect and respect them. Their lives are as sacred as our own.\\n\\n'These rumours tell of a street charlatan. They call him Ezôti. His words are sweet but his deeds are dark. He parades animals around for show. He whips them until they do his tricks.' Ilaya spits on the ground, to show her displeasure.\\n\\n'He does not understand the pact between humans and animals. He does not see them as we do. To him, they are just a means to buy coin and praise. Cheap entertainment, to be used and discarded.\\n\\n'Go to Umbar Baharbêl, find Gûshida. She can be found in the Upper Ward of the city. She is like you and I. She understands animals. She is looking to expose Ezôti and end his crimes. You've done much to help us and the animals here. Please, find Gûshida, and help the animals there. They don't have much time.'",
