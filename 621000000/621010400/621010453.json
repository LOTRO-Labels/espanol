The tunnels of our delving have collapsed, and we have lost access to nearly a third of our richest lodes. If we intend to clear them out, we will have need of many more stone-biters. Stone-biters, you ask? I believe they are known as cave-claws or whisperbacks to other folk, or so I have been told. \\n\\n'We have long used their knack for burrowing to clear less valuable stones from our mines, but after the tremors, many of them burrowed beyond our reach. They have done similarly before... but not for thought of escaping, mind you! They simply become too excited in their burrowing and just keep digging. Sooner or later, they will burrow back to the surface, but never quite where you lost them!\\n\\n'If you encounter a stone-biter in a harness of sorts as you travel among the Iron Hills, they are one of ours! You may need to convince them to come along, if you understand my meaning. Ah, but do not worry about being too rough with them. They may as well be made of stone!\\n\\n'Deliver them to me, and I shall get them back on their feet!'",
