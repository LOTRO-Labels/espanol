Nowadays, though, one has to wonder...they are wandering down from the north in large packs, and they seem more than just hungry -- there are rumours that many of these packs were bred by the goblins in the north-lands to be particularly vicious and dangerous towards Men and hobbits and to ruin the herds of livestock upon which many of the towns of Eriador depend for their food.",
