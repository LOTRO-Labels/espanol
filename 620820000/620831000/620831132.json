I remember that one used fire and another oil. Talug himself is clad in thick armour, against which even dwarf-made weapons are almost futile. But it makes him slow, and metal gets hot when heat is applied.\\n\\n'Aside from this, we only know that he is Mazog's chosen general and thus his right-hand. Defeat Talug and cripple Mazog? It is a difficult question to answer, but we can hope this is the case.\\n\\n'You will need to scour Fil Gashan, south-west of Anazârmekhem, to find the General.'",
