The Mead Hall is nestled up near the cliffs with the Study, Smithy, and Armoury tucked behind it. Below that are areas for the inhabitants of each of the four eastern Ridings. To the north-west of the walls are a few farmsteads, while on the south is the remains of a lumber-mill and water-wheel.\\n\\n'Before we get started on the repairs, I encourage you to take a quick look around and familiarize yourself with the town.
