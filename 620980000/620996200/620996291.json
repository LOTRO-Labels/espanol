None know why she goes where she does, or if she is doing the Horror's business when she is given to this wandering, but I will keep watching.\\n\\nShe makes me uneasy. She looked right at me, though she was some distance away, and I felt a burning in my head.\\n\\n(The message is not signed, but it is covered in blood. The Ghâsh-hai from whom you took the message must have wrested it from the original bearer in combat.)",
