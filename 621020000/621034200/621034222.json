Midsummer is such a busy time of year for orders and without my assistant.... say, if you happen to be free, I could make it worth your time!\\n\\n'I just need a few simple things. With your help, I could get so much more done. Now let me think... my assistant chopped wood for me, but I sent him away before he collected it. You'll find that he has felled pine trees about the area. Pine burns nice and hot! Oh! I had a special order for a set of dishes with willow leaves imprints. There's a lovely weeping willow south of the city, near the lake. Now, while you are out and about, I also have an order of lace that needs to be picked up from Maud Tatter.\\n\\n'Let me think, is that everything?
