For the goblins it holds only the memory of dwarf-work, and that is a sharp dagger-point of hatred to them, though they covet the treasures and gems their foes unearth.",

When it was burned and destroyed by Scatha the Worm, and Frumgar gravely wounded, his young son Fram swore vengeance upon the great wingless dragon. Eventually it was done, and Fram became Fram Wormsbane. The Ai-thúda rebuilt Fasthálla and gave it a new name: Framsburg.\\n\\nFrom its location high atop a rocky spur in Misthallow, Framsburg could not be easily-conquered by Orcs, though they tested its defences and the resolve of its inhabitants from time to time. After the departure of the Éothéod, Framsburg gradually fell into ruin through neglect. It was never sacked, but in time it stood empty and Orcs prowled the ruin.\\n\\nToday, worms and drakes have built nests among the skeletons of ancient buildings, and Framsburg is theirs. In this way perhaps Scatha has at last achieved his revenge upon Fram Wormsbane and the memory of his people.",
