On the Simple tab, choose your preferences and Instance Finder will work in the background, allowing you to continue playing while it searches. When a match is found, you will be informed of the group's makeup and then teleported into the instance it found.\\n\\nThe preferences you may set are as follows:\\n<rgb=#DAA520>Role:</rgb> Instance Finder will attempt to create groups that have a good mix of the different player roles. Select the roles you are willing to fulfill in a fellowship.\\n<rgb=#DAA520>Type:</rgb> There are different categories of encounters Instance Finder can match you into, such as Skirmishes, Instances, or Epic Battles. Skirmishes consist of all Skirmishes you have access to. Instances consist of all the scaled Classic Instances you have access to. You may also find another category containing the most current instance cluster, where you will find the most potent rewards.\\n\\nRemember, the more options you select, the better chance Instance Finder will be able to find you a group!",
