The path he has chosen winds through the foetid marshlands of the Drownholt. He names it Râd Cened and tells me it should be free of Orcs.\\n\\n'But Raddir spoke of other hazards, the like of which we may not expect: spongy earth that clings to the foot, thickets of briars that will catch clothing and armour and break your concentration, great pools of stagnant water that can slow your progress to a crawl. You and the other members of the Hidden Guard will need to be cautious of these and other dangers. Few travel through the Drownholt, unless they have very good reason to do so. Keeping beneath the Enemy's notice until Mazog is at his doorstep is one such reason.\\n\\n'Speak with me again, and I will show you to the rest of the company for this leg of the journey.'",
