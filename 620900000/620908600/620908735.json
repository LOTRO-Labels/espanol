He has put forth a strong effort in guiding his people toward the safety offered by the city walls, and has wisely withdrawn his best riders to defend its gates. Against a large scale invasion, were it to come to that, it would be easier to secure a single guarded city, rather than a multitude of poorly  defended outposts, scattered across the plains.'",
