Guardians also have skills that draw foes' attention away from their allies and to themselves.   In fellowships, a Guardian forces enemies to attack himself, so his more fragile allies will not be harmed by the foes.</li>\\n\\n<li><rgb=#FFFF00>Lore:</rgb> The Guardians are the stout protectors of the weak and defenders of those in need, loyal companions to the end. True Guardians stand to the forefront of battle, shielding their allies from enemy assaults.\\n\\nThis class was inspired by the hobbit Samwise Gamgee, whose loyalty to Frodo Baggins knew no bounds.</li> ",
