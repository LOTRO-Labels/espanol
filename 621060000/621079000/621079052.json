Thinking back over our journey across King's Gondor, I am reminded of the dwarf who warned us of the Kindred and their agents when we visited Furukzahar. Gangur Farwend has no reason to love the Kindred or their allies, and he also suffered on our account. I do not want to leave that debt unpaid, if it might be possible. Furthermore, he may have learned something else of Kh√¥ltekh the Cunning that will be of use to us.\\n\\nI do not know where Gangur went when he departed Furukzahar, but perhaps he said something to one of the guards of the gate there, and they might point you in his direction.",
