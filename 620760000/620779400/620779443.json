They mean well, but I trust the strength of my arms more than any well-meaning constable.\\n\\n'Trouble is, the smiths are tasked with too many duties and their prices are far too high! If you have any connexions, or a weaponsmith that holds you in friendship, I'd pay you reasonable rates for a bronze axe and two bronze blades, and throw in a few sundries as well. The axe will serve me until I can replace the blades of my own sword and my son's with whatever you can bring me. Hurry now! The Chetwood is full of those villainous Blackwolds!'",
