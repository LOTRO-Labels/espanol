How wrong I was!\\n\\n'We expected to find a small colony of glass-spiders, but it's a lot and they've dug in. It seems most of these webs were made by an old spider known as Glérgangol—and she means to make a new lair of Glittengrof! And if what already happened to the others is any indication, I don't think she's too keen on guests. Too bad for her, I suppose, but these caverns belong to the Longbeards... and to Durin the Deathless!\\n\\n'Lord Stormhammer has tasked us with reclaiming Glittengrof, and that means putting an end to Glérgangol and her daughters.
