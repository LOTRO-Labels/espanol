Vóin never learned which of these came to pass, and I cannot say.\\n\\n'But of this I am quite certain. Whatever may have been the fate of this knight of Gondor, the blade she carried out of the Morgul Vale survived. Orthadel was of Elf-make, wielded first by Magoldir the Elf during the Siege of Barad-dûr and later by King Eärnur of Gondor, but in time its history was forgotten, and its name was lost. It became just a sword, handed down from bearer to bearer for many years. Somehow it found its way into the hands of a Dúnadan, and became an heirloom of his house.\\n\\n'That is how it came to the Ranger Golodir, [placeholder]. Yes, though it endured much over the years, I think the sword that would be remade in the forges of Rivendell and renamed Dúnachar was once known as Orthadel.
