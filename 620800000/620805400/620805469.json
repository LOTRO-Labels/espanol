Without my finest arrow, I've no hope of putting things aright again either. I need your help, if I can beg it of you!\\n\\n'Since I was separated from my fellows and found myself in this farthest and coldest extent of Forochel, things have only gone from bad to worse. Now I have lost my lucky arrow -- I know it flew truly and struck that worm I was hunting, but moments after I let it fly, I was ambushed by a band of Gauradan-hunters! I escaped from their ambush and made my way back here, but I twisted my ankle badly during the flight and cannot retrieve my precious arrow. It has been with me for many a long hunt now and to lose it this way -- it is a terrible omen, I say.\\n\\n'I am sure my arrow remains in the scaly hide of that worm. The hunters in this camp call it Beleganc and say it is the most cunning of its breed upon the glacier. Finding it out there will be no simple task I fear.'",
