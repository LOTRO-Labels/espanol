The horse he rode was not fully broken in, and, I confess, I provided her to him. He had arrived at the muster with his late father's steed, half lame and half blind, and in all honesty, I thought he would have bonded with his new steed by now. I thought he would have caught back up with us, as well, and that has not happened either!\\n\\n'If you are heading that way, would you look for the young man? He will be in Ost Rimmon, most likely, unless he is still out hunting for his horse.'",
