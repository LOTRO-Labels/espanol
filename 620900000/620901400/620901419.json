Then what good are you, [placeholder]?'\\n\\nDrafli's annoyed expression changes into one of puzzled confusion as you pass him the wooden figure that Maedal asked you to give him, and you speak the message she gave. He looks at you in silence, then down at the figure in his hand and back up at you.\\n\\n'What in the name of Durin the Deathless am I supposed to do with this? And what is Maedal talking about? I have to get it back? What?'\\n\\nThunderclouds cross his face as Drafli thinks. At last he seems to come up with something.\\n\\n'I think there may have been two of these wooden figures. Maedal wants me to come back with the other one, I suppose? Maybe she's waiting to spring me from this cage until she gets her other carving back? That is probably it. She's a strange one. I have never understood burglars. Slay Orcs on this hill until you find this figure's companion! Bring it back to me when you do! I am ready to be out of this cage!'",
