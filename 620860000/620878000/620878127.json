Somehow, with all of our focus on the tomb-raiders and brigands in the south, a scouting force from Angmar has slipped into one of the ruins.\\n\\n'This is a disaster for us on several fronts. Something here is of enough value for Angmar to send a force to find it, something that we do not yet know of ourselves. If they were to find this thing, it could turn the tides of war, not to mention what could happen if they find the refuge of Tinnudir. If they use that knowledge to somehow find Esteldín...I cannot entertain those thoughts.\\n\\n'We must drive them out, and we must sow confusion among those who remain. Their plans have been tacked to the walls of the ruins. If their numbers were thinned and their plans destroyed, perhaps we will stand a greater chance.'",
