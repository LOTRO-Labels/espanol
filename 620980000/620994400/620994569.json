While it is filthy, it is not as toxic as the waters around us in the slag. No doubt then, a product of Orc occupation. Now, this other sample is interesting. The water here is much purer. I believe our initial thought, that the maggot creatures were the ones who dug these holes, is indeed the correct assumption. This is very interesting and I look forward to learning more once the battle concludes.\\n\\n'What troubles me, though, is that every maggot you have encountered thus far seems to only be in the larvae stage. Once fully grown, these creatures could potentially be terrifying.'",
