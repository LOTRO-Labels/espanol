I think I may have gone around in several circles since I found the rock I slept behind three times today. I'm not sure if this place has an end but I found an interesting-looking cellar of some small supply shed. I peeked outside and found an overrun farm. That did not seem to be my answer either.\\n\\nHopefully tomorrow will be a better day. I think I will spend my night in the cellar. It may be a little safer.",
