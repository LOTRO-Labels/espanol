The only difference is they are melted by the corrosive breath of the drakes. I admit it is not what I was hoping to see. I thought Kh√¥ltekh the Cunning might have gotten the shiny material that was embedded in his medallion from these islands, but if so its location remains a secret.'\\n\\nHe sighs heavily and then looks at you with a more open expression than you are accustomed to seeing on his face. He seems almost haunted.\\n\\n'When I fell in the water I swallowed too much sea-water, and I felt the life leaving me. I cannot tell you now if my eyes were open or shut, but I believed them to be open, and before the blackness took me... I saw it.'\\n\\nGangur pauses, as if gathering the strength to go on. You let him wait until he is ready to continue.\\n\\n'It was a great shelled beast, all tentacles and siphons, and its spiral shell was encrusted with the shining jewel of my dreams, glimmering like an opal but with every facet a riot of colour. Huge the creature was, but it paid me no mind even as it filled the great expanse of my vision. And then it was gone.\\n\\n'Was this the dream of a dying dwarf, [placeholder]? Maybe it was. But I cannot forget the sight of it. That vision will haunt me to my last day... I know it.\\n\\n'Thank you for listening to my story, but please do not tell anyone else of it.
