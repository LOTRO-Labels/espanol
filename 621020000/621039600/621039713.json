Far have I travelled in Middle-earth, chasing rumours of fabled beasts and dangerous game. Whispers of marvellous creatures lurking in the Wildwood reached my ears and I set out immediately to make my way to these forests. \\n\\n'Imagine now my horror when I came across poisoned traps, laid by the filthy Orcs and poachers who have infiltrated these woods. Poison is the work of cowards, not of true hunters. I am on the trail of something huge, so I cannot attend to it myself, but if you were willing to destroy any of the traps you come across, I would make it more than worth your while.'",
