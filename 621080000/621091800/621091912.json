Though many of the Corsairs lost at the Harlond were not good people, many in the city are still suffering from the loss of loved ones.\\n\\n'That is why I have decided to use my personal savings to seed a fund that will help support those left behind. They suffer needlessly, and I will do what I am able for those who are innocent. This savings of mine is not held in a bank. I have kept it hidden should Mêshka and I need to flee the city again.\\n\\n'It is always good to have a backup plan, but it bothers me greatly knowing that I have treasures hidden away doing nothing when it could be helping people in need. I would like to entrust to you the task of retrieving it,  as there are dangers involved that I have no doubt you can handle. The coffer is located in the north-east part of the sewers. I will mark its location on your map.'",
