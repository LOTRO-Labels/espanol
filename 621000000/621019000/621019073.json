So great was his desire to possess the Black Book that he thought to release his claim upon this land in order to get it! Nothing I have deciphered to this point explains his yearning for Vóin's tome, but I have seen enough of this Gúrzyul to know we should hinder his plots whenever we can.\\n\\n'Karazgar may be a master of deception, but I think his desire for the Black Book of Mordor was truthful. Does he believe it could hold the secret to maintaining his power, or his life's essence? Can it be possible that the book records his birth-name, his Bugdash? If that is so, surely he will seek it unceasingly. Despite Karazgar's defeat, he will one day return and try to seize it; the book cannot stay here at Skarháld.'",
