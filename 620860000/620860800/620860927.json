It is as if the horrors that fell upon that place scarred it in some way, some way that the stones have not forgotten. It would be a brave [placeholder] indeed to explore the place from top to bottom!\\n\\n'Some rooms in Minas Elendúr can only be reached by stairs within Delotham, and the opposite seems also to be so!
