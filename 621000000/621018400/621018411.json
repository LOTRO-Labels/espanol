We rested in Rivendell and called it home, but never for long; we were always off again on our journeys before the sun had set a dozen times, and we wandered the wilds and came to villages unfamiliar and strange. This was our practice for almost an age of the world, but Edlothon grew sorrowful at the changes he saw, the places that were damaged by the ravages of war, the losses inflicted by Sauron. In time we did not journey as often, and we spent longer in Rivendell than we did away; this has been the last of our travels.\\n\\n'My brother departs, but the memory of my wanderings with him remain, and that is how I know your herbalist friends are mistaken: the purple Anorloth of today bear little resemblance to the Anarlossë of legend.
