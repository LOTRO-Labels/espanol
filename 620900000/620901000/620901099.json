I would know this craftsmanship anywhere: this arrow was made within the Golden Wood, within Lothl√≥rien. I know whose arrow this is, but I will not speak his name here in the open.\\n\\n'He did not loose this arrow for practice, or to test its flight: he fired it at a foe. See the blood on the point? He hit his mark. He sought to defend his companions from Orcs, that much is clear, but one thing troubles me: why did he leave this arrow behind? It is still intact, and could be used again on the road ahead. What spurred him to leave with such haste that he could not collect it, if leave he did?\\n\\n'Danger, I do not doubt. But it is a danger he survived, for he is not to be found here in the East Wall, is he?'",
