Save it.\\n\\nYou are the Mouth of Sauron and will talk. Very well. You wish to talk of heirs? One was promised me by the Dark Lord himself after the war was won.\\n\\nKnow that I am of the first days and last of my kind. It is I who was worthy to be his bride, stand next to him, give him an heir. And remind me: why were you worthy?\\n\\nYou, husband me and rule Mordor together in Sauron's place? Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.\\n\\nForgive me, Dulgabêth. I was over-hasty and in my grief and loss, cruel. Be my consort and king. Together, we shall conquer and rule.\\n\\nBanners of the white tree crawl all over Gorgoroth. If you are so worthy of the throne, do something about it while I arrange the meeting of our peers.\\n\\nYes, once again I insist we stand before what remains of the Dark Lord's lieutenants and sanctify our troth. Or would you have them band together and war against us?\\n\\nWelcome to Seregost, O Black Word, Mouth of Sauron, Red and Scarred of Face, simpering wretched fool. Did you really think I would wed the likes of you?\\n\\nYou who failed in battle, who failed in strategy, in diplomacy, in foresight - in all but vainglorious strutting - I have you now, Dulgabêth, right where you belong.\\n\\nYou have your wish, Dulgabêth, my dear. You will rule Mordor with me. Not by my side, it is true, but at my heel.",
