My line is one of a proud history, though I alone survive now... my father fell in the same battle that claimed Reeve Dagred. My love, DÃ©orwine, has gone to serve at Edoras, and I have long awaited the day when we are again united. I intend to hold Walstow to my very last, and though some of my men do not stand with me in this view, I will not falter in this charge.'",
