I hope you will enjoy the wonders that the spring season has to offer before you, too, wander off to the Spring Planting in Bree-land. The hedge maze there is drawing many of my kindred thither.\\n\\n'A company of Elves, led by clear-headed Saelthaliel, went to the Spring Planting many days ago to observe the green walls on the Horse-fields. I have not heard from them since, and I truly did not expect that they would be away so long.\\n\\n'If you find yourself at the festival grounds in Bree, please look for Saelthaliel or any of her company. Remind her that Ethuilwereth will not go on forever, and that she and her company should hasten back if they wish to enjoy it before it has passed away until the next turn of the seasons.'",
