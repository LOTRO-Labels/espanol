It reads:\\n\\n'We Zh√©lruka prize our claim to these mountains, but the rocky cliffs are home to other less noble denizens. The Mithrin worms claim them as well, and do not willingly surrender their hold! Strike them down and show we are, as ever, to be feared!\\n\\n'But I urge caution in one respect. Worms of a reddish, coppery hue will put up a fight but can be bested. But if you see a worm with ice-blue scales, you may have found Holkorm, more ferocious than these others. He may be a worm of a different brood; I cannot say for certain. I offer a reward to any who can rid these mountains of Holkorm and thin the ranks of the Mithrin worms that threaten our expedition.'",
