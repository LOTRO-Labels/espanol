You say that it came from a place of evil, and the feeling of it is so corrupt that I do not question it. I can tell you the story of that needle, for now I know its ending.\\n\\n'Maushkán was made weak by Deilur's needle, and it caused him a great deal of pain, but it was sunk deep into his flesh and he could not remove it. He returned in time to his own land, but every day was a torment, for the needle pained him so. He must have learned to live with the pain, but every sharp twinge was a reminder of Deilur's defiance. There was no day he did not think of Deilur, and in that way he was very like me.\\n\\n'But while I am now grown old, the oldest woman in Lhanuch, I think Maushkán did not reach such an age. There came a day when he succumbed, at last, to the pain of Deilur's needle, and when his body was gone only the needle remained. Perhaps some villain picked it up, never knowing what it signified, or any of its history, and it came by long roads to you, and then to me.\\n\\n'This needle travelled many leagues to have its vengeance upon Maushkán, but now its task is done. Farewell, Deilur! You have been avenged, and this old woman remembers you and what you did, and always will. And now [placeholder] will as well.'",
