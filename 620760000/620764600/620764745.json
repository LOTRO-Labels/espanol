But not all the folk of Angmar are enemies to us. There is one clan of Hillmen in those lands who have ever been our friends, sending south to trade with us when they can. Perhaps they will be friendly to you as well.\\n\\n'Like us, they hate the Orcs, and they stand against the evil ones who rule in the black city. We want to let them know that the main body of Orcs has now passed south into the North Downs. This may help them in their counsels, and perhaps they can resume their trade with us.\\n\\n'Find the man called Crannog. He is the Chief in Aughaire. Tell him the news I have told you. Aughaire is west from the northern pass of Ram Dúath, in a concealed valley over a steep rise in the hills. Sometimes in the past, the men of Aughaire travelled a steep trail to our village -- a trail the Jorthkyn are too big to walk, but perhaps you can find it not far from here.'",
