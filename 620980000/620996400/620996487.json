How can I live with the shame of it?'\\n\\nYou tell Frodo that what little you learned of the Ring during your own adventure has taught you that it was an artifact of great power and great evil, and that it could work its temptation upon even those of good hearts and strong will.\\n\\n'Maybe you are right, [placeholder]. Your words do not erase my shame, but even though the Ring is gone I can still remember how I felt in that moment, standing above the Fire. I did not wish to destroy it. I would have rather died than allow it to be taken from me. I cannot imagine how Sm√©agol survived for so long after the Ring came to Bilbo. Or perhaps I can. It was the desire for it that drove him, and that feeling is familiar to me, and painful.\\n\\n'Pippin worries that I will forget the details of my journey if I do not write them down? But the details are etched upon my memory. I cannot believe that I would forget how I felt in that moment. But perhaps I should write it all down. Perhaps I should write it all, and it will serve as a reminder and as a warning. A reminder that Good purpose can go ill, but that Evil purpose might still serve Good. And a warning not to judge either too readily.'",
