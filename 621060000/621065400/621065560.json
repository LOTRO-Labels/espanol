Prince Ostir perished last of all, sobbing with despair as one of Carn Dûm's warriors drove a spear of cold iron through his heart. His bones, and those of his company, vanished among the downs.\\n\\n'I have written it! Is that what you wanted of me? I have finished it! My duty is fulfilled... but the account is too terrible.
