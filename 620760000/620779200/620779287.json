There are two sets of ruins in the southern expanse of the Marshes. I would ask you to go to these ruins and defeat any goblins you find. If there are goblins near both ruins, we'll have a better idea of how far they've spread.\\n\\n'The first set of ruins are found south-east of Eldo Swatmidge's farm, east of Staddle. South of his home is a narrow stretch of land that extends into the Marshes and runs right to the Sunken Stones. The Goblinhole Ruins are far to the east and south of those.\\n\\n'When you are done, check in with Bill Mossfoot.
