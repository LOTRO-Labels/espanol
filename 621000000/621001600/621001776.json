She does not reveal herself easily, but I have seen the local Orcs leaving their dead at an offering stone for her. It is then that she leaves her lair to feed. I suspect if you slay some of the Ungol spiders nearby and leave them on that stone, she will appear. Then, you can strike her down and rid Lhingris of another powerful enemy.'",
