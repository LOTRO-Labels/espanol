      "en": "Sirgon, former Lord of Lebennin, greatly desires to sail again, and King Elessar has suggested that he be given the chance. He currently oversees the rebuilding of Gondor's fleet, but that task can surely be given to his son Faltharan if he does agree to join the crew of the Wave-hunter. Sirgon has a great deal of experience at sea and on the water, and I have little reason to suspect he would refuse this offer. His familiarity with fighting the Corsairs of Umbar, developed during his many years of service to Gondor, may also prove of use.\\n\\nYou will find him inside his manor in Pelargir, in King's Gondor East.",
