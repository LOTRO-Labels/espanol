South-west of this hall stands a great host of Orcs, and they have claimed the Forges of Khazad-dûm for their own. We have learned that they are using the dwarf-forges to craft weapons, and are working fast to arm themselves in an assault against our neighbours in Lothlórien! We are doing all that we can to stop them, but I bet you would like to be involved, outsider though you are.\\n\\n'An adventurer such as yourself would look forward to a little dare such as the one I am about to propose: go into the Forges of Khazad-dûm and slay as many Orcs as you can. They are many; ever do their numbers swell, and ever does their threat increase.'",
