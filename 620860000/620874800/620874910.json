Somehow, with all of our focus on the tomb raiders and bandits in the south, a scouting force from Angmar has slipped into one of the ruins.\\n\\n'This is a disaster for us on several fronts. Something here is of enough value for Angmar to send a force to find it. Something that we do not yet know of ourselves. If they were to find something it could tip the tides of war. Not to mention what could happen if they find the refuge of Tinnudir. If they use that to somehow find Esteldin... I cannot entertain those thoughts.\\n\\n'We must discover the intent of this scouting force and determine if more are following them. This must be done with posthaste. No delay can be afforded.'",
