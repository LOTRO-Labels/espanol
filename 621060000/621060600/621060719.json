Our home was taken from us by Men and we were chased away. Hraubrek wanted to reclaim our land. That is why we have returned. I followed Hraubrek because I believed in his wisdom. Now I am lost, for Hraubrek allies with our enemy. All our alliances have ended in death. How will this one be any different?!\\n\\n'I have answered your question, now leave me be.'",

The day after the Angmarim visited the stone-giants, we saw our first and only movement from the encampment of Hlídborg. Two giants left the camp. One was Hraubrek, Chieftain of the Grímklettar, who marched off to the north with purpose. We were unable to follow. The second was a stone-giant who stomped away from the encampment in anger.
