He kept a home in Járnfast more than a thousand years ago, but the Black Book you found within the hidden chamber there is all that remains of his life. Vóin himself appears in no other record that I have found.\\n\\n'The writing of dwarves, or at least that of the Longbeards I have known, is generally straightforward and to the point. Not so that of the Zhélruka! Indeed, while I have not had occasion to study many works of the dwarves of the East, Vóin's writing in the Black Book seems more convoluted than others of his kind. He writes in multiple languages, using many different runic alphabets. Furthermore, some of these scrawlings are clearly written using a cipher, or I am not a Wizard! There are curious gaps between some of these lines and on some of these pages. Khîl's cryptic ancestor may have written some of his account with hidden letters, [placeholder], but unless we learn their trick they will remain invisible to us. That is a pity, but I warrant the visible writing will keep us busy enough!\\n\\n'He writes often of the lost city of Thafar-gathol. It seems to have been a preoccupation of his.'",
