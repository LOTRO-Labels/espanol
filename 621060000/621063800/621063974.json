      "en": "The Yondershire is traditionally considered the 'wild' part of the Shire, the last part to be occupied by the hobbits centuries after the original settlement of the rest of the region. Originally covered in woods that served as hunting grounds for Gil-galad and, later, Elendil, it became part of the province of Arthedain when Arnor was settled but preserved as wilderness by writ of the king. Later kings, however, razed the old forests for farmland; some woods later grew back but much of it remains open country, heather-covered moors and fields of rich tilth that support such crops as barley, hemp, and cotton.",
