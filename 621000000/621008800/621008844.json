Indeed, evil spirits lingered there, but they did not seem to notice our passing. It was Karazgar and his Men of Mordor that fell upon us, and I rose my blade to attack. However, as Karazgar raised his weapon against me, I felt my mind and vision turn to darkness. It washed over me in what felt like mere moments, but when I awoke, I stood before Felegoth... alone.\\n\\n'I know what fate must have befallen my kin, but have the Valar themselves spared me? They would not do such a thing! They could not... and nor could she....'\\n\\n'When Caras Tilion fell, one of the servants of Valar fell with it. She was known to me as Tárasánë, but among my kin, she was the Green Lady. I thought her banished or gone to the Uttermost West, but I cannot bear to return to that place again.\\n\\n'I ask you to do what I cannot. Go to Caras Tilion and see what became of my kin.
