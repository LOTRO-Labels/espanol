We have not seen them in Evendim until recently, when Tyl Ruinen, the island on the west side of the lake, became infested with the creatures. At night, the island seems to be burning with the flames of these strange beasts.\\n\\n'A number of salamanders have also been seen in the Barandalf, south and east of Tinnudir -- could it be that the creatures are spreading? Venture to Tyl Ruinen, if you are willing, and discover the source of this plague of salamanders.\\n\\n'There is a ruin in the centre of the island called Tollobel. Perhaps some clue to the origin of the salamanders may be found there.'",
