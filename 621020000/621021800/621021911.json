There were Elves crawling all over that ruin, and we barely escaped with our lives! We had to take the long way, and ran into some trouble with Her minions; they were going our way, and none of the boys wanted to chance it. We're going to try the Elf Gate next.\\n\\nBut we found the opening spell, or part of it, anyway. The Falch Gurth won't remain closed to you any longer. How badly do you want it?\\n\\nMaybe me and the boys will bring these words to Gothmog. He'd find them interesting, wouldn't he, and I wager he'd be quite generous. You promised a reward! Double it and he'll never see this opening spell. I am sure you will make the right decision, boss.",
