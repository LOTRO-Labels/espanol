Our foes rally at many outposts on our borders. They have great strength and are driven by bitter malice. Their armour is thick, such as we have not seen since the dwarves wore the armour of Durin's time, and their weapons are hard and cruel.\\n\\n'I believe they are using the Halls of Crafting in Moria to produce great stores of tools to assist them in the war. Lord Celeborn agrees, and we fear for ourselves and for the dwarves. Will you go to the source and banish the evil from that place? You will need stout allies to aid you on this venture.
