From there you can give the NPCs orders that change their behaviour in battle and provide them short term bonuses. This includes telling them to heal, take out shields, prepare for siege fire, focus on defeating sappers first, or shaking off a corruption. The potency, cooldown, and variety of orders you are allowed to give can be upgraded, improved, and unlocked through the Promotions tab of the Epic Battles panel.",
