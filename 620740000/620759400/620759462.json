      "en": "THE CAVE OF NURATH\\n\\nAt the base of the slope that rises to Thorenhad, walk east along the rolling hills. If you were to follow the slope as it rises on your left, you would come in time to the ruins of Ost Thondol. Instead, when you see the line of stonework on the cliff's edge, look to your right. You will see Nurath among the rocks.\\n\\nTHE CAVE OF TOROGROD\\n\\nTorogrod is not far from the Last Bridge. Leave the road and strike north into the wild. East of Ost DÃºrgonn you will find a space between the hills that will allow you passage north. A gentle slope on your left rises to Torogrod.\\n\\nTHE CAVE OF THINGROTH\\n\\nThingroth is not far from Torogrod, but the ruins of Ost Belegram are known to be thick with stone-trolls. If you have a good deal of faith in your abilities, and in those of your allies, you can pass through the arch of Ost Belegram and travel a short way north to the camp of Thoroniel, currently scouting the North Trollshaws at my brother's behest. She can guide you to Thingroth, for she is most familiar with that area. If you choose to avoid the dangers of Ost Belegram, you will need to pass further east; there is no assurance that the way is easier, but you may be fortunate.",
