Wolves have long dwelt in the Trollshaws, and though evil by nature, they have generally kept to themselves. Now, however, they have become bold and dangerous. I daresay, I have seen fear in their eyes the like I have never seen.\\n\\n'It is true that servants of the Enemy pursued a small company along the road not more than two months ago, but the wolves have become more unruly in recent days, and I cannot determine the reason.\\n\\n'If you would, hunt the wolves of the Gorges in the vale between here and Thorenhad. Perhaps you may find some evidence of what has disturbed them. Follow this road eastward until you find the white marker stone. There, take the road north and begin your hunt.'",
