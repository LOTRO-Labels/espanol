I have returned now to see that this place is restored to the beauty and reverence for which it once stood. My efforts to collect and catalogue the lore go poorly. Even worse, the blight affecting the trees has left me with little hope....\\n\\n'Hope, however, is never truly lost, and so I ask you to assist me. These trees have resilient seeds, and if any have survived the years, they will be found in the embrace of the leaves scattered about their trunks.\\n\\n'I know that you must test your mettle against the creatures now plaguing the trees, so I hope that this small task will not hinder your goals. Will you assist me?'",
