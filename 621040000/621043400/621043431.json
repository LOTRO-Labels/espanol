Tell me everything!'\\n\\nYou tell Ausma of the out-camp you ransacked, pinning the blame on Gorgar's forces; of the drake nest you disrupted; of the unpleasant information you learned regarding the Angmarim and Loknashra. You hand her the two notes you found. She reads them quickly and looks at you with an eyebrow sharply raised.\\n\\n'The Cult of Drugoth? Wasn't he one of the Gauntlords? And isn't he dead? I think we're dealing with necromancers. And this Loknashra character seems to have more influence here than the warlord wanted to admit, if her agreement with the Angmarim was sufficient to end all hobgoblin-raids on their settlements. This is very troubling. Is there something else, [placeholder]? I see that look on your face.'\\n\\nYou carefully remove the crystal the goblin gave you from your bag and hand it to her slowly. She hesitantly accepts it, and winces.\\n\\n'Ah, the Angmarim are still playing with their crystals, I see. This one seems a little different than those Mother Amma showed me in the Elderslade. A more thorough investigation will have to wait. We need to move on the Angmarim and remove them from the Pit of Stonejaws before they raise an army of ancient dwarf lords to kill us all!'",
