I have spent the last two days fleeing through this trackless wilderness trying to escape from wild beasts and wild men alike, until finally I found some refuge here.\\n\\n'Imagine my dismay when I discovered that several sheets of my most prized anthem had been lost during my flight! I need to get those sheets back! Thinking back through my misadventures of the last few days, I think I know where they might have been lost. You see, there was this enormous bear, which tried to steal the rations from my pack before I managed to calm the creature with my songs and slip away -- only to stumble into a band of those horrid snow-beasts or whatever they are -- I think the locals call them peikko? In any case, I had nearly beguiled the lot of them with my finest performance yet, when a Gauradan-hunter snuck up and nearly put a spear through me!\\n\\n'Needless to say, those wild men are poor patrons of the arts at best, and I took my cue to flee into the night. It was not until I later found a chance to collect my wits that I realized my prized anthem was gone! Will you please hunt down those horrid beasts and retrieve my music? I may be able to make it worth your while.'",
