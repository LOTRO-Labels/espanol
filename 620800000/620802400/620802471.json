Either choice will shift their Attunement, unlocking more potent skills, but restricting access to others. In addition, they have support skills that may always be used. In fellowships, a Rune-keeper keeps allies healed or deals significant damage to the foes.</li>\\n\\n<li><rgb=#FFFF00>Lore:</rgb> Rune-keepers are gifted linguists and masters of true names. With this knowledge, a Rune-keeper crafts powerful rune-words that help the Free Peoples. Through unparalleled mastery of Angerthas and Tengwar runes, a Rune-keeper evokes much more than a normal scribe.  Dagor runes deal with battle, Nestad with healing, and Thalas with support.\\n\\nThis class is inspired by the master Elf-smith Celebrimbor, whose skill with runes of power was unparalleled.</li>",
