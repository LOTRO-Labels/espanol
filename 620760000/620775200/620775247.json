These days your idea of a spider starts at about two feet across and goes up from there -- hardly the kind of thing you would expect to encounter in the cozy Shire, yet now they seem to be common in all the forests of Eriador. It is enough to make even the most staid and placid hobbit sit up and take notice that things are getting rather queer these days.",
