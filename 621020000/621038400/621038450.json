Now, I wouldn't say I'm an expert on goblin-kind, but I have had enough run-ins with them to know that they love gold more than anything. So I had to think fast, and... well, I told them I had been an adventurer in my younger days, and I had hidden sacks of gold in the mountains.\\n\\n'The goblins fought among themselves for the right to my treasure, just as I thought they would! This fellow won the contest right quickly, before I could get away, and the next thing I knew I was locked in that cell here in Goblin-town! I couldn't tell them the truth, of course: that there were no sacks of gold. When I adventured with the dwarves I did end up with two small chests of silver and of gold, but that was a long time ago and they were never as large as the rumours around the Hill would put them!'\\n\\nBilbo claps his hands together.
