We would fire our arrows back and forth, listening for the twang of the bow string, searching for our enemy in the dark. It broke the monotony of guard duty, but a dangerous game it was. At rare times we traded taunts -- though we were each careful to move so as not to be discovered -- and I learned this creature's name is Urbhrum.\\n\\n'Urbhrum had not loosed upon us for several days now, and I fear he has fallen to the fungus. These infected Orcs are unpredictable and dangerous. I do not know what drives them, but an Orc of Urbhrum's skill under the influence of the spore could be a terrible threat.\\n\\n'Go to The Chamber of Dark Waters, east of here, and seek out Urbhrum. If he is to be found, destroy him, lest his arrows return.'",
