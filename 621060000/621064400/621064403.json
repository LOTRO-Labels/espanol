We are aware of a number of issues involving delayed or lost mail that some hobbits have reported over the past few weeks. Rest assured, the Quick Post will get to the bottom of it!\\n\\n'With that out of the way, who are you? How can I help you today?'\\n\\nYou introduce yourself to Postman Grubb and ask what's happening at the Quick Post.\\n\\n'Pleased to meet you, [placeholder]. I'm Walto Grubb, and I've been a postman going on twelve years. I'd say it's my calling, if you believe in such things! As for what's going on with the Quick Post, I wish I could tell you. Like I said, the mail's been turning up late or not at all, and the folk in Yondershire aren't too happy about it. I don't know if the Postmaster's been trying something new or altering routes, but I don't think that's it.'\\n\\nPostman Grubb looks around and lowers his voice.\\n\\n'Between you and me, I think someone's been tampering with the mail. If you're of a mind to help me sort this out, meet me inside the Quick Post.'",

We've had a few postmen come up from the Hithershire with small deliveries, but none of them are taking as much as they ought to to deliver back to the rest of the Shire. It's almost like they're trying to slow the whole thing down. For goodness' sake, we've had a parcel due for Stock sitting here for over a month!\\n\\n'Ebbo received a delivery from the Quick Post of Waymeet this morning, and as usual, it was very light. Unfortunately, after I inspected the letters and parcels, I only became more suspicious that someone's been deliberately tampering with the mail.\\n\\n'Why don't you head up front and take a look at them, [placeholder]?
