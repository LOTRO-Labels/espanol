I could not believe it.\\n\\n'But it is one thing to hear a command, and it is another to obey. Hrímil may think she motivated the dwarves to strike against Gundabad too soon, the easier for her to destroy us, but she did not. It was the voice of a dwarf that I heard beyond the Anvil of Winterstith, [placeholder], a dwarf-voice that drowned out the words of the Dragon. I will listen to that voice, and no other, and it spoke of victory in Gundabad.\\n\\n'Depriving Gorgar of this mithril hammer is simply the first step. Next we will deprive him of his armies, and then we will take his life. And then we will come for his Dragon-master. She fears this hammer? Then let it be her undoing!'",
