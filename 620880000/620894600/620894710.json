It has been some time, ta-rum, since a shepherd of the forest has been over there... the Huorns there must have long ago grown wild and dangerous.\\n\\n'Yet I recall them from when I was an Enting, and would have them rest, if they can, and see their seedlings grow in a more peaceful place where we can watch over them. Hoom-hom, if you could bring me a few of their seeds, I would be much obliged... though it is likely that they will not let you gather them peacefully.\\n\\n'Simply fend them off and wear them down if you can... often when a Huorn becomes exhausted in battle, it may fall asleep, becoming much like any other tree for a time.'",
