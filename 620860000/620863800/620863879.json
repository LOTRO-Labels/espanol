Kúfthak and Sarghúd took their bands north once the blockade was in place. My clan was glad to see them go, but you are wise and must know best. Enclosed find a sword we took from an upstart on the road. He put up a fight, but was no match for one of my archers, who shot him from hiding. You will find the sword interesting.\\n",
