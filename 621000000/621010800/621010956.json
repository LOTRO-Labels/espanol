If you can believe it, many such maps were made and kept from the distant days when Durin's Folk called these cold Grey Mountains our home. Indeed, I brought some with me, knowing they might be of use.\\n\\n'You wish to know of spider-paths that touch upon the Glimmerdeep? Let me see. Yes, there were many spider-tunnels beneath these peaks. However... the only ones to touch on Glimmerdeep cut straight across the mountain into Stormwall. You may be in luck! \\n\\n'Hum... yet do not judge your luck, perhaps, until you have found your way there and inside. Mountains shift and rocks fall, after centuries! You will want to take some climbing gear with you when you go.'",
