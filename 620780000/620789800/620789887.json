A Dúnadan-landholder buried something somewhere in Evendim, fearful that it might be taken by the Witch-king's forces if Fornost fell. It seems that the landholder's line was extinguished in the battle, his lands abandoned. But I believe that his treasure remains unfound.\\n\\n'Here is the riddle, [placeholder], the only directions I have found, and those not easy to come by:\\n\\n  \\qTwo roads pass through green fields.\\n   Four kings watch the meeting of the ways.\\q\\n\\n'I do not know where this might be, but there is a cross-roads east of Tinnudir.
