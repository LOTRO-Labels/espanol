They have been infected by something, is what I think, but I have no idea what. I have been keeping some of them in cages below this cliff and go down to study them when I get the chance, but I have a small problem. One of them keeps managing to get free. There are many more out there, but the last thing we need is for her to get to the others and bring an entire clutch down upon us.\\n\\n'Head down the cliff here and then look along the path to the north. She normally does not go far, I think she views this as some sort of wicked game. If you prod her enough, she should come running back to the safety of the cage.'",
