      "en": "I have been thinking about what you said of the Ent Leafshade. Would he be willing to join the crew of the Wave-hunter? No, even as I write these words I doubt them. Would he even want to board a ship, even one so fine as the Wave-hunter? It is made of wood, after all!\\n\\nSo perhaps Leafshade will not join the crew, but he is very well-travelled. Can it be he has ever made the overland journey to Umbar, even in days long past? If you consult him he may have useful information. You may believe I have written this down simply to learn more about such creatures as Leafshade, and I cannot deny it completely, but I believe in my very bones that he may know something that will help you.",
