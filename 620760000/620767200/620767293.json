He is an old one...the oldest such creature I have ever seen. The other brutes seem to treat him with the greatest reverence. He may perhaps be their ruler.\\n\\n'For my own part, I am ready to leave this place, but if you would, I think you can do more here. Slay as many of these vile worms as you can, and fight your way to the depths of the cave where Ulkrank dwells. Once he is defeated, tell my friend Fonn in Tyrn Lhuig of your victory. He will surely be concerned about me.'",
