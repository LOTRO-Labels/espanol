I do not know what you will find in the freshly-unflooded portion of the tomb -- it might be best to bring allies with you.\\n\\n'I fear that the tomb-robbers that prowl Evendim will take advantage of Gwindeth's decision; long have the waters prevented them from gaining access to the lowest levels of Elendil's tomb. Now that this barrier will be gone, the robbers will rush to seize what treasures they may. One such band is led by Idella Crypt-breaker, a notorious robber, and she will not remain idle with the promise of riches unclaimed.\\n\\n'Gather allies and speak to me when you are ready to journey to the tomb, and I will show you inside. Confront Idella if you find her within the tomb and reclaim the Silithar for Lord Aragorn!'",
