Ferny was working to assist the brigands loyal to Sharkey to join with the Tarkrîp Orcs coming from the north. Such an alliance would pinch the resources to Bree-land from both sides and spell certain doom for her people. Your efforts here in the north have done much to assist us in seeing that the Orcs are broken and their strength diminished.\\n\\n'Your recent discovery of a cave built into the cliff face at Cirith Nûr leads me to believe that the cave will serve a terrible purpose; a place for Ferny to meet with the Orc-leaders and facilitate an arrangement to further invade Bree.\\n\\n'It seems now that you have been chosen to avert this invasion and shatter this alliance once and for all. You will need to return to the encampment at Cirith Nûr and enter the cavern to disrupt the alliance. You must see that the Orcs and evil Men do not succeed in their plans. Are you prepared?'",
