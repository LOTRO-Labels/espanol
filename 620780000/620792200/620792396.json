If we can retain the element of surprise, my brethren and I will be more than a match for him. Present yourself to this lieutenant of Amarthiel and lure him to this end of the causeway! We will fall upon him and take him prisoner, and then we shall see what this trusted servant of Amarthiel may be able to tell us.\\n\\n'This foe is in no way weak, [placeholder]. You will be in danger as you lead Mordrambor to our position, and we will not be able to help you -- if we reveal ourselves too soon, all will be lost. Tell him something that will make him curious enough to follow... perhaps you have found a weapon that can destroy him. He will doubt such a weapon exists and will follow you willingly to disprove it. Luck be with you in this, [placeholder].'",
