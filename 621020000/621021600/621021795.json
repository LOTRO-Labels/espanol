      "en": "Shortly after his coronation, King Elessar of Gondor decreed that Imlad Morgul should be cleansed of the evil that settled there and the Dead City razed to its foundation. In furtherance of these tasks, Elessar named as Prince of Ithilien Faramir, the son of the last Ruling Steward. Elessar also ordered the formation of the White Company, a band of knights who would serve as Faramir's household guard. Captained by Beregond, the White Company would perform many heroic deeds on behalf of and at the command of Prince Faramir, especially within the dark vale of Imlad Morgul and the Dead City that lay within.",
