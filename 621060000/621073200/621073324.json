Many of these ingredients are harmful alone, but work together to numb the subject of pain, and increase feral tendencies along with an uplift in all physical aspects. But this solution can produce an end product of varying potencies, depending on the order in which they are mixed. I have deduced that there are four very potent mixing orders to create the most effective serum. Since the gate to my apothecary will only open to a certain potency at any given time, I have devised a way to help me remember which mixing order is correct.
