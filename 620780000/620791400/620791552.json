Perhaps those robbers can someday be redeemed.\\n\\n'Would you travel to those ruins and find Miluidir and defeat him? It would be but a brief reprieve, for none but a higher Power can banish him from this world. Be warned though, Miluidir must be defeated before dawn, or he will hide once more and plague the robbers again upon the morrow.'",
