This is a major event for them. Many of them have seen these animals before but never gotten a chance to get up close.\\n\\n'There's a lot of work to do before the animals are ready, though. First up are the sheep. They got out of their pen in a storm last week, and I need your help gathering them back up. They're pretty docile. If you go up and talk to them, they should follow you for a short bit. Just lead them back to the pen.'",
