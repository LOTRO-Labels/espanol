We must put an end to Khatlob and her brood, or our people will never be safe, in Imlad Morgul or elsewhere.\\n\\n'Some of Khatlob's caretakers remain, led by an olog known simply as Khúrthak the Rent. He possesses the keys we will need to gain access to the spawning ground. While you face Khúrthak, I will attempt to enter the Rookery.\\n\\n'One last thing, friend. Khúrthak and his fellow ologs are possessed of a furious rage, and only a soothful vapour can calm their fury. I will give you a set of phials containing this vapour, but there are more in the chest next to me. If an olog enters that state, throw one of these phials at him and he will be calmed.'",
