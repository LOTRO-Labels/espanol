He is like a great, fat spider, weaving webs of treachery and deceit! We have seen no sign of him or of his uruks since you departed. Something must have been keeping him busy.

One of the Rangers stayed here for awhile, a young man named Corunir. Does he still fare well?'\\n\\nYou tell Frithgeir that Corunir was fine the last time you saw him, but you have not seen him since you left the Gravenwood.\\n\\n'I see. I hope he is fine. I am sure he will be. I know he was frustrated by Nár, perhaps with reason, but he was generally kind to us in a difficult situation. When the uruks attacked, he would have died for us.

I am glad you came back! That Ranger doesn't visit as much anymore. You know the one. His name was Túgonn. Never ate with us, which I thought was odd. Wasn't that his name? Túgonn?
