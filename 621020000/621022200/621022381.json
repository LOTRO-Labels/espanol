I saw King Durin from afar, but even from such a distance I could see his face was ashen, and the fire of battle had gone out of him. I spoke with Huneric Hundred-slayer, lord of the Thíuda, and my heart wept to hear his account of the battle on the field of Khôn-khaigu.\\n\\n'\\qWe had so many victories!\\q he said to me, \\qBut it was a deception. We were drawn forward by the promise of those successes, and only when we thought the end was near did Sauron's commanders reveal the true size of the Easterling horde. We fought valiantly, Man and dwarf alike... but we could not fight for long against so many. Any who survived the massacre fled, and I fled with them. Those who could not were captured, cut to pieces or burned on altars to Sauron. A few score can move faster than a horde, and we outpaced the Rhúnhoth, but still they come. They will be here before long.\\q\\n\\n'So said Huneric to me, and I must bring word to my father. Tell my brothers I will see them after I deliver my message.'",
