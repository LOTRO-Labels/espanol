Alas, it seems whatever errand sent them there was not undertaken out of fear, but that they might one day return in greater wickedness to Angmar. Now, the Angmarim of the Iron Crown who served the False King and the tribesmen of the Trév Duvárdain still loyal to them have reclaimed the city of Carn Dûm.\\n\\nThe Trév Gállorg have not forgotten the aid you offered our tribe against the False King and the oppressors of the Iron Crown, but I must ask for your aid once again. When first you came to Aughaire, I offered to you a Fém—a purpose, a challenge, and the duty of all those who would call themselves Trév Gállorg. You fulfilled your Fém and saw it to its end. This day, I write to bestow upon you a new Fém: travel to Bail Avarc and aid us in casting the Iron Crown from Carn Dûm, once and for all.\\n\\nChieftain and twice-humbled tribesman of the Trév Gállorg,\\nCrannog",
