There you may barter for the Water of Forgetting. This water can make you forget your troubles, and if you drink enough, even who you are.\\n\\n'The Shagâni who run the Well are rumoured to be Barkhûshim, adherents to the Church of the All-seeing, with loyalties only to their dark lord. I believe they are up to something sinister at Tûl Zakana. Would you scout the outskirts of the Well? I fear we will not uncover all the Well is hiding, but any clue could help us learn more about the Well and its secrets.'",
