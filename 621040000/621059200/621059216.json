And besides, [placeholder], there is still much to be learned from these glow-worms. It is only a matter of knowing where to look!\\n\\n'Are you familiar with how glow-worms digest what they eat, my friend? They possess complicated gizzards which become more effective when traces of stones and precious minerals are lodged within them. If we were to collect gizzards from these glow-worms, we might learn what ores and minerals they have recently devoured. And by we, I mean you, of course. I am a proud lore-master, not some butcher of beasts and insects!\\n\\n'You don't mind helping me, do you? Oh, and only the adult glow-worms will have what I need, so you can leave the wormlets be!'",
