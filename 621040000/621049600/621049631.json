      "en": "My trusted friend,\\n\\nAlthough we have made inroads against many of our foes in Mount Gundabad, I am told that Prince Ingór of the Zhélruka has chosen to divide his forces and send an expedition into Câr Bronach. It is true that the Iron Crown has proven a more determined foe than we had anticipated, but I question Ingór's intentions in ordering so many of his warriors upon this errand. To eliminate the Angmarim and their wicked allies would be a great boon, but there are foes enough within the mountain. I fear Prince Ingór's actions may put the rest of the Gabil'akkâ at greater risk. Indeed, if his expedition were to fail, any advantage we fought to gain against Gorgar and Hrímil would surely be lost. Worse yet, if I were to confront Prince Ingór directly on this matter, it could threaten the alliance between the Longbeards and Zhélruka.\\n\\nAnd so, I hereby order you to join the Zhélruka in their campaign. Learn what you can of Prince Ingór's purpose in sending his warriors to Câr Bronach and aid them in hindering the Iron Crown. When that is done, let us hope the tide of this war remains in our favour!\\n\\n\\nPrince Durin Stonehelmson",
