In ages past, each of the tribes selected a warrior to fight on its behalf in a ceremonial combat, called a Clúcath. The victorious tribe was understood to become the leader of all the others until such time as another Clúcath was called. It has been many years since the last, during which the Trév Duvárdain violated the laws of mercy required by the ceremony and slew our champion.\\n\\n'North of Aughaire is a hilltop where the Clúcath has always been held. The place is called Fail-á-Khro. Travel to Fail-á-Khro, and when you reach it, you must turn north-east. After some distance, you will see a line of torches ascending another slope. Atop this final slope lies the Cairn of Honour. Climb the Cairn and retrieve the Stone of Clúcath from atop it, then bring the Stone to Crannog.\\n\\n'We must trust our chieftain. If he believes that the time has come for Clúcath, he surely has some knowledge we do not.'",
