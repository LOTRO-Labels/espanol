It is clear to me now that the Warg-riders are in fact servants of Saruman of Many Colours. It also appears that the Brenin and his brehur are in league with them!\\n\\n'I believe I now know the origin of the Wargs... one of the items you brought to me was a piece of rune-marked tree-bark. It is in the tongue of my own people and can be found upon ritual trees in the Gravenwood. I believe that the Warg-riders must be encamped somewhere near the Gravenwood, along the road to the north.\\n\\n'You should know as well that other duvodiad from the north passed that way, Men allied with the Boar-clan resistance. One of them -- Amlan, I believe his name is -- is encamped just within the eaves of the Gravenwood. If you would help me against the riders, I am certain Amlan will have a reward for you.'",
