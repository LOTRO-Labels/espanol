This lore was thought lost after the destruction of Beleriand, though rumours persisted that at least one copy was brought east of the Ered Luin before then.

The Golu o Maeth: my people spoke of it with awe when I was young, and have mourned its loss ever since. We have learned much about the link between runes and combat, of course, but to have this book in my presence is as the first time one hears the sweetness of a harp, or beholds the silver light of the moon.\\n\\n'It wounds me to find so many of its leaves ruined by the passing of time, though it is no great surprise. Thousands of seasons have passed, and it is a wonder that it survives at all. Yet if one copy escaped Beleriand's doom, perhaps others did as well. If the lost pages were but recovered... but that, perhaps, is too much to hope....'",
