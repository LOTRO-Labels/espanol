      "en": "Defeat these three opponents to prove you deserve to be called a champion!\\n\\nZHURPUKH OF THE DEEPS\\nThere are goblins in the Midgewater Marshes north of the Great Road between here and the Lone-lands, and they have their own chieftains. The chieftains do not concern me, but a great goblin has come with them, and he trains always on the slopes at the very eastern edge of the marsh. He is called Zhurpukh of the Deeps, and he is the greatest of the goblin-champions that have crept into that place.\\n\\nFAIR SHERMAN\\nDeadly too is the half-orc called Fair Sherman, named so in jest by his crude brethren -- there is nothing fair about the ugly creature. You will find him in the South-guard ruins at the entrance of the Andrath, south of Bree. Look to the ruined watch-tower of South-guard, for Fair Sherman does not associate with his kind if he can help it. A grassy slope right of the entrance should let you gain entrance to the tower, though you will need to be light on your feet.\\n\\nMORLEY THE FIERCE\\nMorley was fierce, but his brigand cronies were not. When they were defeated, he sought shelter in the Old Greenway Fort, north of Bree and east of the road. The ruins of the fort are occupied now only by creatures of the wild, and by Morley. The defeat of his band of brigands did not make him any less dangerous, but a true champion should have no problems ending the threat he poses to travellers in that region.",
