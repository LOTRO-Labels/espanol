I've gathered what information I can from all these texts you've brought me, and I think I shall be able to give you a nice reward for this next bit of burglary I'll have you do. Don't you love a good challenge?\\n\\n'There is a terrible enemy in the Sixteenth Hall, an Orc named Unur. He is a curse-shouter of no small skill, and he hates Burglars more than anything, for it may have come to pass that I plucked some valuables from under his nose and sneaked away unnoticed. He will answer a summons, but be wary and bring company with you! I'll warrant he'll have some friends too.\\n\\n'I may have picked his pocket, but I hadn't the gall to face him down in a fair fight. If you can defeat him, you will prove a great Burglar indeed, and I will humbly teach you all that I know.'",
