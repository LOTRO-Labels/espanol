They are clever, they are devilishly strong, and they are hard to kill. The Lossoth call them peikko, and they are becoming a more and more serious threat as their numbers increase.\\n\\n'Kill several of them, and your legacy will be assured. They can be found all over, but especially in a cave they have infested. Go directly east of here and up the side of the hill and look for a cave entrance.'",
