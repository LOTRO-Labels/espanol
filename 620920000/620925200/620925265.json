The will of Théoden is clear, but I do not believe you come here with evil intent. You speak of dangers to the north, and all around, but returning here brings the greatest danger upon yourselves! Is that not the truest sign of your good hearts?\\n\\n'The King must be told what you have seen. Speak to me when you are ready to continue into the hall, and I shall take your weapons as is the custom. Then you shall proceed before the King, and we will see if I have misjudged you. I hope for your sake, and for mine, that I have not.'",
