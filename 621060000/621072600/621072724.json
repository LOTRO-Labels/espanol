      "en": "Looming high above Carn Dûm, Gwathrenost was erected long ago during the reign of the Witch-king of Angmar. It was from this nigh-impregnable fortress that Angmar waged its long war against Arnor, devastating the kingdoms of Arthedain, Cardolan, and Rhudaur. After the battle of Fornost turned against the Witch-king of Angmar, it was to Gwathrenost he fled, but he was overtaken by the forces of Eärnur and Glordindel before he could return to Carn Dûm. With Angmar all but destroyed, it laid abandoned for many years until the False King and Steward of Angmar, Mordirith, brought about the first rebirth of Angmar and summoned those still loyal to the iron crown of the Witch-king of Angmar into his service at Carn Dûm.",
