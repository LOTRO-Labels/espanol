I hope that in the future we can build and make it grow and flourish.\\n\\n'I am prepared to take a large step towards that. I know where the tomb-robbers make their primary camp. It is a small island at the north end of the lake called Rantost. Many of the relics they have pilfered are kept there until they can find buyers for them. I imagine the history they are keeping there is immense and invaluable to the Rangers.\\n\\n'Months ago, I sent three of my men to join the tomb-robbers. They are now on the isle of Rantost, still working for me. I am now willing to use them and have them expose themselves and challenge Rantost for the Rangers. Seek them out, and they will tell you what to do next.'",
