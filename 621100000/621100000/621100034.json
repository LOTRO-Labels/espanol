It is known as Tûl Zakana, the Well of Forgetting, whose waters will make you forget your troubles, and, if you drink enough, even who you are. But unless you are trading for this water, it's best to stay well clear of the Well, for many have vanished near it, never to be seen again. You are now tasked by the families of the vanished with investigating the Well and its secrets.",
