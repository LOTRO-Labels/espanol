However, he seemed dismissive of the regimentation and orderly nature of the Muster, referring to them as a band of 'useless fops and dandies what hadn't a notion which end of a pike they ought to be on'.\\n\\nIt seems that he then went about forming his own little band of ruffians and skirmishers from among those hobbits of the more aggressive sort that he could convince to join him -- an act of insubordination that surely would have seen him in irons if they had not quickly proven themselves to be among the most proficient scouts and ambushers in the entire force.",
