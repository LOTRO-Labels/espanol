To my great surprise, who should I see descending the steps but Tatháta the Beast herself, kinswoman of the Lower Ward? She is a towering, imposing figure; if you have ever seen her, you know she is not a woman with whom you should trifle! But on this morning she was not alone: she was walking two of her great hounds, the ones named Nûdil and Jôzi, around the amphitheatre. They worked up quite a sweat, the three of them, conducting great circuits of the structure.\\n\\n'And it gave me an idea: if I did as Tatháta did, would I develop into as physical a specimen as she? So I have been coming here and walking down the steps, across the way, up the steps again, and following the curve of the seats back here. You should do the same! Why not make three circuits of the amphitheatre, friend? Be sure to start by running down the steps to begin!'",

I have found it to be so, ever since I adopted this means of exercise!\\n\\n'I have not seen Tatháta or her hounds out this way in several weeks. Perhaps they are at sea again on some errand of the Kindred. There was a time she would walk through the Lower Ward and you could observe the crowds parting before her and her dogs wherever she went. They were friendly and would not bite, of course... although the same might not be said for Tatháta!\\n\\n'Just a little joke, my friend. Perhaps you will do me the favour of keeping that one to yourself. But you are welcome to come back and run or walk around the amphitheatre whenever you like!'",
