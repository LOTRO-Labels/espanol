They worshipped Ferndúr, believing he could grant them the victory...and indeed, the plague he harnessed would be so great a weapon that Arthedain and Cardolan could not hope to stand against its threat.\\n\\n'He gave to them the plague, the Red Cloud, but they could not control it. The Men of Rhudaur who lived and worshipped at the Lost Temple were laid low by the weapon they sought to wield. It was their undoing, but Ferndúr did not weep for them, though it cost him many servants. He merely laughed as the Red Cloud claimed its victims.\\n\\n'I am glad you have ended his threat.'",
