After the Battle of Greenfields, Haldemar became a Warden of the Shire, and told many Tall (or rather short) Tales of adventures beyond the Bounds, many of them humorous accounts of battle against goblins and trolls and other beasts, some wholly imagined. Though much of the book is whimsy, there is truth at the core that any Warden would value. Sadly, the three known copies of the book were all stolen, suspiciously, within a week of one another nearly a century ago.",

The pages are swollen, the ink smeared ...it appears to have been left out in the rain, or thrown in a river. Much of it is illegible.
