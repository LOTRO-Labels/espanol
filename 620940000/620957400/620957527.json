I fear they search for something and work for the same cause. I have been researching ancient tales to learn their plan, but I fear they will succeed before I do. I wager there is some sort of ancient power buried in Angmar and these beasts are searching to unearth it. Will you help me by defeating these beasts before Angmar is cast into darkness from their foul plans?'",
