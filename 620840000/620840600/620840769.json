Though we have encountered many Wargs trained as curs of the Enemy since we entered Mirkwood, we had thought the common wolves would stay at bay from our forces. It seems we were wrong, and there are those among them that would stalk our scouts should they travel alone.\\n\\n'Those of us who have learned the guttural speech of their kind have made out the name 'Sharpfang' among their wild howls -- it seems this leader claimed the kill, and I would see the beast put down as a lesson to the others that they dare not obstruct the Malledhrim.\\n\\n'They have been seen to gather some evenings by a stone circle to the west of the Wild Ruins called Hrigg Vidukuni by the Woodmen who dwell in Mirkwood. You may be able to find their leader there and deal with him.'",
