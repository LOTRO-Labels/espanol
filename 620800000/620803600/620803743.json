Their unique Warden Shields and a variety of defensive skills allow them to stay in the fight longer than most. Basic Warden skills build up their Gambit chain, which can be spent to unleash special Gambit skills. In fellowships, a Warden forces enemies to attack himself, so his more fragile allies will not be harmed by the foes.</li>\\n\\n<li><rgb=#FFFF00>Lore:</rgb> The Warden patrols the borders of civilized lands, preventing the encroachment of fell creatures from the Wild. They limit themselves to medium armour so that they can travel swiftly and silently to defend those they protect from threats. Wardens all have some military training and have mastered a style of combat that uses combinations of basic attacks to create masterful Gambits.\\n\\nThis class was inspired by the marchwarden of Lothlórien, Haldir, and his brothers Rúmil and Orophin.</li> ",
