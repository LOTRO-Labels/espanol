Fall is considered by many to be the greatest of seasons, with the weather fair and the herbage shifting from uniform green to a vast array of autumn colours.\\n\\n\\nEVENT LOCATIONS\\n\\nThe Shire:\\nThe Party Tree in Hobbiton\\n\\nBree-land:\\nThe festival grounds in the Horsefields\\n\\nThorin's Hall:\\nThe tavern in Thorin's Hall\\n\\nEred Luin:\\nThe festival area of Duillond\\n\\n\\n\\nRETURNING EVENTS\\n\\nThe Haunted Burrow\\nWhere: The Party Tree in Hobbiton - It seems that a door has been excavated, and rumour has it that there is treasure to be got inside!\\n\\nThe Festival Run\\nWhere: The Delving Fields in the Shire, and the Horsefields festival grounds in Bree.\\n\\nYou should travel to all the festival locations across Middle-earth to bob for apples, pick pumpkins, collect geodes, and scry scrolls. You may also perform tricks for onlookers and collect as many tokens as you can for this year's excellent rewards. Lastly (but not least,) you mustn't forget the Inn League... unless of course you prefer the Ale Association.",
