      "en": "Through the ages of the world, many peoples have inhabited the Vales of Anduin, but in the latter days of the Third age only two remain: the Beornings, the fabled Bear-folk who know and hold secret the art of skin-changing, and the Woodmen, a superstitious and rustic folk who have long dwelt on the fringes of Mirkwood, now named Eryn Lasgalen. Together, they have come to be known as the Wilderfolk. Although far removed from the greatest of its battles, the War of the Ring took a great toll on the Vales of Anduin. However, after departing the Vales of Anduin and wandering Middle-earth for many years, Radagast the Brown has returned to aid the Wilderfolk and seek shelter in his old home of Rhosgobel.",
