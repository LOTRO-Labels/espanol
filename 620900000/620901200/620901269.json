Ah, yes, this is what I suspected.'\\n\\nWilferth holds out a pair of the short arrows for you to inspect.\\n\\n'The length of the shaft is a clue to its origin. This arrow was designed to fly a short distance fairly accurately. It is of the type used by Orcs of Mordor and is primarily a skirmisher's arrow. It is well-suited to combat among the trees of the East Wall and would be less of a threat upon the plains of Rohan. The danger of the Orc that fires this arrow is the danger of surprise. If you know he is there, he will be less effective.'\\n\\nWilferth presents to you a pair of much longer arrows.\\n\\n'These are more troubling. The length of the arrow tells me it is to be used with a much larger bow, drawn by a stronger arm. The Uruk that fires this arrow expects it to travel much further than those fired by his Orc-brothers. This is an arrow ideal for combat on the plains of my homeland, and I fear it was designed for that purpose.\\n\\n'The Orcs and Uruks in the East Wall are equipped for different purposes, [placeholder]. They possess different goals, but I can tell you one thing they share at least: they hate us and are all our enemies.'",
