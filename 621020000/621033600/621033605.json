You remember me, surely? Rodwen, Champion of Gondor? We met near Parth Galen, along the East Wall of Rohan! My friends and I had gotten into a bit of trouble, and you helped us get out of it. I was quite surprised to see you again in the throne room of the White City, in the presence of King Elessar, no less!'\\n\\nYou ask Rodwen what curious road took her out of the wilderness and gave to her the responsibility of planning a king's wedding. She raises her hands level to her shoulders with an energetic shrug.\\n\\n'Would that I could tell you! The adventuring life was hard, and to be honest with you my friends may not have been entirely prepared for it. The road we thought to take north was crawling with Orcs, so we turned south and arrived outside the Pelennor Fields just as the Gondorian force returned from Mordor in triumph. Happy timing! We joined the celebrations, of course, and decided that perhaps it was safer to put our adventuring days behind us. We no longer had a minstrel, you may remember; Cuilinn decided to try a life of farming rather than our dangerous course. Well, he has given it up already. Farming was not for him!\\n\\n'So we all came to settle within the White City, and through a series of misunderstandings and some ill-advised boasting my friends and I caught the attention of the Council of Gondor. The next thing I know, Isteron is speaking before those noble lords and ladies, insisting that we are expert wedding-planners all! So we have stumbled our way into something of a real adventure, [placeholder]. You have to help us... again!'",

We cannot lower our guard overmuch, it is true, but Mithrandir and the Council of Gondor both assure me that the threat of further war is at a low ebb, for now. My mind therefore turns from martial matters to those of the heart, for a day long prepared is nearly upon us.

It is very important to me and to my love that the ceremony be conducted properly, but my knowledge of such matters is not sufficient.
