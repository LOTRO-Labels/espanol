I feared my leaving would sadden him since his age and health prevented him from leaving Ethring. It is good to hear that my brother and you have become friends. He will one day be a great warrior and I am sure you helped him immensely. I hope that I will be able to help Ethring by being here. Thank you for your news of Ethring and the Vale.'",
