For that you have not only my gratitude but that of every dwarf whose heart longed for the Mountain-home to be restored. So too do you have the thanks of dwarves not yet born, who will now know a world where Gundabad will never again be held by the Orcs.'\\n\\nDurin nods, that business accomplished.

I would have us reclaim it, as we have with Gundabad... but I cannot tell if only failure awaits us as it did the Iron Garrison, and Balin before.'",

One day, perhaps, it will fall to me to lead another union of dwarves to the Doors of Durin, and on that day Khazad-dûm will belong to dwarves forevermore.\\n\\n'In this age or the next, did he say? Let us work together, then, and see that the age that comes will be one of peace and prosperity for all the good folk of this Middle-earth!'\\n\\nDurin takes one more look around the chamber and hefts the Red Axe in his hand.\\n\\n'And in the end, perhaps the lesson of Mótsog will be this: not all stories end when they seem to, but rather they continue, and you cannot fully judge one's part in it during the telling! Both good acts and evil shape the world, in Gundabad no more nor less than anywhere else, and it is the duty of good-hearted folk to care for those who dwell in it. Will you take up this duty with me, my friend, and make that the legacy we leave behind?'\\n\\nYou assure Durin that he can rely on you.\\n\\n'Very good, [placeholder].
