This is what it sounds like aloud:\\n\\nHydig Fengel, wanhoga ic ðe hate\\ngnornung sceal bið seedleænung þin grædignysse.\\nNan reccend þin ryhtfæderencynnes longe gebideð sceal\\nNan sunu sceal on þin stole setteð.\\nCynn and cyningdom þin crafiende acwellede hæfð\\noð þæt mihte Mearces edniwigende is.\\nWyrgende\\n\\n'Lovely, is it not? But the meaning is anything but lovely, of course:\\n\\n'Feckless Fengel, fool I name thee,\\nGrief shall be the get of thy greed.\\nNo lord of your line shall long live,\\nUpon thy seat no son shall settle.\\nKin and kingdom your craving hath killed,\\nUntil the might of the Mark is mended.\\n\\n'The means of breaking the curse is unknown, but it is widely believed that only once the Kingdom of Rohan is able to achieve the greatness it had of old will the curse be broken.'",
