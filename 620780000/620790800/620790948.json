      "en": "17 September:\\nAnd so at last I return -- for the first time! -- to my ancestral home near Annúminas. My lineage lived long in our ancient manor, and it is a necessary and proper thing that the children of the Dúnedain come at least once to their olden homes.\\n\\n19 September:\\nI stopped at Tinnudir to pay my respects to Calenglad. He warned me that the region grows ever more lawless, and that grave-robbers and brigands are a constant threat. It is hard for me to believe that we have fallen so low that we must truly beware of such things. But I place my faith in Aragorn son of Arathorn and trust that he will restore our ancient glory.\\n\\n20 September: In truth this is a strange land. I had wished to feel welcome in these old lands of ours, but there are uncanny things abroad: strange lights floating in the mere, unnatural snakes, and worse. Last night, I thought I heard Wargs howling in the distance. When the Kingdom is restored, these things will change -- I swear it!\\n\\n21 September:\\nI am sure now that I am being stalked. But not by evil beasts -- by men! I hope to make Annùminas tomorrow, though, and surely the watcher and I will be able to hold off any number of mere brigands and robbers.",
