We seek to keep alive the memory of the Tower of the Moon and the virtues that it represents. There are few of us left in these dark days, but that makes our charge all the more important.\\n\\n'I have travelled with this band of adventurers ever since I met them at Cair Andros, to the south. Our goals are not precisely aligned, but I could not make the journey north on my own, and they professed a need for another protector on the road. I did not know how badly they needed it: they have not done the first thing for ensuring their safety at this camp! It is common cause enough, for now.\\n\\n'Do you see the great rock out there in the water? It is called Tol Brandir by the Elves, but to Men of my kind it is the Tindrock. It is said to be unclimbable, but I worry that an Orc-archer could do some hurt if he managed to make it a perch. Swim out to the Tindrock and circle it once, looking for sign of an Orc-presence. It would make me feel more secure, friend.'",
