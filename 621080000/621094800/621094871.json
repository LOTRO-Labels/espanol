We will not let this happen.\\n\\n'And this, my friend, is where prospectors come in. The ever-burning ore located in this mine burns hotter and longer than any coal we have yet to find. However, there is a problem. The ore is extremely volatile and needs great care when being removed from the lodestone herein. It is time-consuming and dangerous.\\n\\n'Overseer Skuld Scentlode will track the progress of all prospectors and provide prospectors with details of the undertakings needed to support the efforts in the kitchens above.'",
