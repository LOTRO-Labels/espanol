She has slain many of our people in the years since the last Clúcath, and her name strikes fear into the hearts of all but Nekhtan, who has sworn to end her. Domongart, leader of the Trév Duvárdain, surely thinks that Nekhtan will be our warrior; he may put forth Avair in the hope that Nekhtan will be blinded with rage and easily defeated. It is difficult to say, and there are others.\\n\\n'Drostan of the Trév Duvárdain is fierce, but his most recent battle ended in a cowardly retreat; he fought with Fonghala for one day and one night before he escaped. He favours fighting from a distance, and fears the dangers of standing toe-to-toe with an opponent. He is surely hurting for the chance to redeem his honour.

For a time, everything seemed as it should: first Avair had the mastery, and then Násan took the advantage. But as the Clúcath drew on, the chieftain of the Trév Duvárdain, Domongart, became restless. Next to him sat two strangers, Men of Carn Dûm, it is thought.\\n\\n'Domongart suddenly rose to his feet and gave forth a tremendous cry: a pre-arranged signal? Násan's attention was diverted, and at that moment Avair knocked him to the ground. The Clúcath was over, but Domongart was not satisfied, and he demanded that Avair slay her helpless foe. This she did, and it was clear that the Trév Duvárdain, our kin of old, were hopelessly corrupted. Násan's son, Nekhtan, swore to avenge his father, but you must do it in his place, for you have bested him, and he is not fit to stand for the Trév Gállorg in the Clúcath.
