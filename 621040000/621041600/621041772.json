Nafni was there on that day, protecting Durin VI while the king treated his Elf-guests to a tour of Khazad-dûm's splendid mines. Durin fell to the Balrog's fury, but he ordered Nafni to survive and protect his son, Náin. And so he did, for Nafni was fleet of foot and was able to escape the terrible creature! He saw that fiend in all of its fiery terror... and lived. Upon hearing Nafni's recounting, Náin was enraged, and vowed revenge for his father at all costs.\\n\\n'The brave soldiers of Khazad-dûm tried to push the Balrog and the Nameless horde in its train back to the depths, but slowly, more and more of the kingdom was to fall. A year later, Durin's son, now King Náin I, gathered his forces and launched one final, desperate attack against the Balrog, slayer of his father and target of his vengeance....'\\n\\n<rgb=#FF0000>Complete 'The Fall of Khazad-dûm' to witness the events of Dáin's story unfold!</rgb>",
