These book-shelves are similarly numbered, ending with C12 at the far leg of the crescent.\\n\\nI turn now to the crescent on the left wall of the library, opposite Section C. This is Section D, but be warned - the book-shelf that is closest to the entrance but remains a part of this structure is D11, and the numbering follows the arc of the crescent backwards: D10, D9, D8, and so on, ending with D1 as the book-shelf at the crown of its other leg.\\n\\nWhen my collection of materials made necessary the formation of a Section E, I encountered a brief difficulty -- the existing tunnels had been sealed off with stonework, resulting in less usable area in that corner of the library than I was promised. Not wishing to air my complaint, given the mayor's generosity to me, I placed only a portion of the traditional crescent of shelves by the sealed doorway. E5 begins on the left wall closest to the stonework, and then proceeds with E6 and E7 through to E10. E11, E12, and E13 are to be found in the very left corner on the wall by the entrance -- E13 being the shelf closest to the entrance -- and E1 can be found on the other side of the entrance, in the very corner. The next three book-shelves, counting towards the entrance, are E2, E3, and E4.\\n\\nBooks and Tomes by Theme:\\n\\nHistories of the Old Kingdoms, Written in the North: B2-B5, C6, E10-E12\\nHistories of the Old Kingdoms, Written in the South: A1, A4-A5, B8, C1-C3\\nOf Plants and Herbs, Volumes 1-4: C4-C5, D6, D8\\nOf Plants and Herbs, Volumes 5-8: E6-E9, A2-A3\\n\\n",
