What with all the trouble we've heard Archet and Combe had, it seemed a wise thing to defend Staddle, especially since its crops feed much of Bree-land!\\n\\n'My superior, Second-watcher Heathstraw, should know of our victories and that Staddle appears to be safe, at least for the moment. I dare not leave my post, though, so could I ask you to bring my report on to Second-watcher Heathstraw in Bree-town? He will probably be near the Boar Fountain. Just head north up the road towards Combe and turn left at the signpost.'",

With the state of things throughout the Chetwood I expected a small brigand presence, but Redweed reports news of goblins in the Midgewater.
