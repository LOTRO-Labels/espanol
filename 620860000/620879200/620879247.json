He is much more active now and has done worse things than we had ever expected.\\n\\n'We need to move upriver and warn the rest of the Boar-clan resistance. The easiest way to get there will be by boat down the river past Wulf's Cleft.\\n\\n'We must prepare for the trip, however. There are rumours that some of the clans are uniting and forming large forces. We cannot travel with a small group of people. There is a large amount of driftwood near the borders of the river along the bog. We can make oars for the trip with it. Hurry. Gather as much as you can carry.'",
