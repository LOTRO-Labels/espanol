I returned to our camp to retrieve enough rope to pull him back to the surface. I moved with all the haste I could manage, but in the few moments I was gone, Greip heard the foul language of spiders and knew the truth of where he had fallen. When I pulled him back to the surface, he related to me his brief adventure in the dark, a story of webs and evil voices.\\n\\n'An evil brood of spiders have taken root in the caverns beneath Helegrod, [placeholder], and the name of their queen is fell: \\qZaudru,\\q she is called, and I know one who has encountered her before. Look for Atli Spider-bane in Bree-land, in the town of Archet, for he will be most interested to hear of the spider-plague that festers beneath Helegrod.'",
