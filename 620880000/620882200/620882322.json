I have not heard from Braigiar since his start into the Gravenwood and young Amarion failed to return from scouting shortly thereafter... I know not their fates.\\n\\n'Yet I dare not dwell on such matters, though this journey has left me all but empty, for I have yet to complete my task.\\n\\n'We find ourselves now before Nan Curunír, and beyond in the tower of Orthanc sits Saruman the Traitor. Looking across the destruction wrought in this vale, it seems clear now that his wisdom has faded, to be replaced by madness. You should make yourself familiar with the land, my friend, for if we are to find our way to Isengard, we must learn its lay ere we are discovered.'",
