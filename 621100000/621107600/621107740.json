While I was trying to listen in on Ethelinda, I heard Sarabeth Lowbanks say she couldn't find her book! Also, I was having a chat with Himloc Grouse, and he said Ferumbras Attereeve's favourite tankard has gone missing.\\n\\n'Now I know what you're going to say, \\qNever trust a Grouse!\\q but I believe he spoke true. And then, as if that isn't enough, I was doing a little shopping at Staddle Arms, just browsing, you know, and I heard Pell Stoneleaf say that his favourite whittling knife has disappeared. Whittling knives don't just grow legs and walk away, as they say.\\n\\n'And on top of everything else, Gammy Boggs, who is very reliable, I must say, told me that Ponto Underhill can't get his work done because he says his shovel was stolen! She, of course, thinks it's quite possible he is just saying that so he can take a break and go fishing, but I think it was stolen indeed. I mean, look at all the other things that have been stolen.\\n\\n'Now, I don't know if you are acquainted with old Maginard Foxbolt, but he says he has seen cave-claws roaming about at night. Cave-claws, if you can believe it! Well, I told him, mark my words, those cave-claws are burglars, without any doubt.\\n\\n'I warrant that if you went into that queer tunnel, you would find all of these missing items along with a company of cave-claw burglars!'\\n\\n<rgb=#FF0000>NOTE: This quest will be removed from your quest log when the current festival ends.</rgb>",
