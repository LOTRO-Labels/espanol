Food is brought from all over the Shire, and our four speedy contestants must compete to see how quickly they can sample each bit of vittles!\\n\\n'Here is a bit of inside information, if you'll be wanting it: Gladdy Chubb-Baggins is actually my favourite this year. Her mother told me in confidence that Gladdy never stops eating for more than a few minutes at a time -- that her appetite is fathomless! Yet she is as spritely as a spring in springtime, wouldn't you say?\\n\\n'Yes, I am fully convinced that she is a sure thing. Would you like to place your faith in her winning the event? I am sure there will be a great prize in it for you if you guess rightly.' ",
