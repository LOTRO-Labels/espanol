      "en": "'The Dwergfant is an ancient dwarf cistern, built into the southern foothills of the Misty Mountains west of Stangard. I do not know how it works, but we discovered it years ago when the waters of the Limlight became brackish and poisoned. We traced the river upstream until we found a flooded chamber, filled with levers, pipes and a still, foetid pool. As we pulled on the chains, the water roared to life and a great vortex began to spin. Soon after, the river became clear and safe again. We now make regular trips to the Dwergfant to ensure its mechanisms are open and working, and the Limlight is safe.'",
