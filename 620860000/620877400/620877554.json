They could have returned to Ost Forod and started to live honourable lives again. Most sailed south instead.\\n\\n'They have come here, made bargains with an enemy they cannot fathom, and have returned to their old ways. While they use Tham Sarch to signal the Angmarim below, they are also stripping it bare. They have had their chances and moments and defied them all.
