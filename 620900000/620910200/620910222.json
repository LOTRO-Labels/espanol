As you learn these skills, they will automatically be placed in your mounted combat skill bar.\\n\\nFor the most part, mounted combat skills work identically to normal skills, you may now queue skills when your intended target is out of range. A queued skill activates automatically the moment the target enters a legal range or arc. Using queued skills in this fashion frees you up to focus on steering your mount.\\n\\nNote that some mounted combat skills will require your mount's power in addition to or instead of your own.",
