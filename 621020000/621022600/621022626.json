Are they true recollections, or the fleeting shadows of stories I was told, the impressions of others? I cannot say. But I know the name I was given. I was born Adûnzagar. It was only the first of my names, and not the last.\\n\\n'My father was Ûrizagar, the captain-general of Númenor's fleets, and his title was Sword of the Sun. Do I remember his cruelty, or his worship at the temples of Sauron? I thought I did. Do I remember the warmth of my mother Abrazâni, or is that memory a creation too, balm for the hurts of my heart?\\n\\n'This I do know: my mother pleaded with the sons of Elendil to make a place for me on their ships when the deluge came to Númenor. In later years, when I was older, Isildur told me that my father's spies prevented her from reaching the ships in time. Was it so? I do not know.\\n\\n'But that is how I came without father or mother to the shores of Middle-earth when Númenor sank beneath the waves.'",

She told the king she had been married in secret, not to an invading Númenórean but to one of his own warriors, who had recently been slain in battle with Orcs. Héol was born of that union, she said, and therefore the stain of dishonour could not cling to him. Rioc's anger cooled, and he agreed to raise the boy as his own grandchild.\\n\\n'I grieved that my son would not know his true father, but there was nothing I could do. I stole gold from the treasury of Prince Eärtur of Belfalas and sent as much as could be done secretly to Bravantel to provide for the boy. But then I was summoned back east by my foster-father Isildur, for the host of Mordor had come down the valley and overthrown Minas Ithil. Sauron's war had begun, and the kings sent word to all their allies that it was time to honour their vows.\\n\\n'It was then that Rioc learned the truth.'",

I quailed before the storm of his rage, and told him not of Bravantel my wife or Héol my son. Would that truth-telling have changed his mind? Would it cause him to repent of his curse? My mind dwells ever on this, not the earliest of my wrongs but the first I regret.\\n\\n'I went north with Isildur and my foster-brothers to summon aid from Arnor and from the Elves, and every night my heart pleaded with me to speak the truth, and every day the guilt pressed heavily upon me and weighed my lips shut. For all my time with the Great Alliance, I kept secret my marriage to Bravantel and the duty I owed my son; my brothers goaded me with the thought I might never marry, and each of their barbs pricked more deadly than they intended or imagined. I feared for Bravantel and for Héol, and when the war finally ended I was frenzied with worry for them.\\n\\n'Isildur offered me the chance to be the captain-general I had dreamed of becoming, commander of all the armies of the Dúnedain, but no longer did my heart desire it. I longed only to return to the White Mountains so I could find my wife and son. \\qThen I will make you more than a mere lord, my son-of-no-blood,\\q Isildur said to me, \\qbut rather a prince, for Ëartur and all his sons perished during the war. Belfalas needs a new master. Go, and take my blessing with you.\\q\\n\\n“I will take your blessing,” I said to him, “but not for me. Show mercy instead for the Men of the Mountain, and lift the curse you have placed upon them. I will bring you their false king’s head, and his people shall swear their oath anew.\\q\\n\\n'But he refused. Always did Isildur refuse me this one request.'",
