The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.\\n\\nIt is said in the most ancient of tales that the world was formed in a great chorus of song, but this story is ancient and shrouded in myth even to the oldest among the living Elves, and no one in Middle-earth today could claim to know the truth of it. Towards the end of the Second Age, during the War of the Last Alliance, there was born a fair woman who sang in such wonderous tones that even the Elves would stop and listen in silence for so long as she would sing for them. Stranger still, she had no teaching in song or music, and yet could compose such melodies as to bring tears to the powerful and the Wise. She claimed that she composed no songs, and that she was simply trying to duplicate a music that she could hear -- a music that she claimed arose from the world itself, from mountains, streams, wind, and tree alike, in infinite variety.\\n\\nMelodies of the Valar is the book that contains these songs as the Elves transcribed them, but most of the copies of this book have been taken away into the West, and very few remain in Middle-earth today. Alas, this one has been damaged, but an Elven minstrel of renown might well be able to shed some light on the matter.",

      "en": "Greetings, [placeholder]. I hope the day finds you well? A book? Ah, and not just any book I see! You have quite a treasure there in hand, my friend. That book is much revered among the Elves. I myself would count it among the finest works ever granted to the world by Men, but then perhaps I am a bit biased. I am sure you know some of the tale behind it? Of the woman who claimed a gift to hear the chorus of the world? It is true, or at least so I believe it to be, but there is a poignant twist to the tale as well that few remember today.\\n\\n'You see, it is said that this poor girl was driven to the brink of madness by her gift, for it seemed that no matter how beautiful those around her found her voice and the melodies she crafted with it, she herself heard only broken, half-finished works from her throat -- a sound which could not compare with the grand symphony which only she could hear. In the end she sang no more and fell silent, for no matter how much those around her extolled the beauty of her song, she could stand her own voice no longer, hearing it as nothing more than a mockery of the chorus she had striven so long to compliment. She lived out the latter half of her life as mute as stone, contenting herself only to listen to the symphony of the world and abandoning her dream to draw it into the world of Men.\\n\\n'Most scholars among Men believe that she was a wonderfully talented minstrel who was simply unstable -- as Men and even Elves sometimes are when true genius arises -- but among the Elves, it is believed that she was truly gifted with the ability to hear the faint echoes of the song from which the world arose, and we faithfully recorded her songs in the years before her voice fell silent. I cannot say from whence this copy came or how it came to be damaged, but it is a book worth pursuing, for no more beautiful songs exist in the tongues of Men today.",
