We need sharp swords and broad shields, but if we study the deeds of yesteryear, we are sure to draw from them lessons that will serve us well even today!\\n\\n'I want to instill in the men under my command some of these lessons. If you know a scholar of some skill, he might be able to make sense of the materials of the past and give to you some teaching of past lore.
