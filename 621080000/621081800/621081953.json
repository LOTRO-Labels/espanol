But since you have, you will hear my words before you and your friend die.'\\n\\nMêshka holds up her hand, signaling to her guards that they should await her command.\\n\\n'For years after Sirgon drove my intended to his death, I lived a life of mourning. Believing he died at sea, I married, and it was a marriage of great happiness... at least until its ending, when my husband was seized by the Church of the All Seeing and burned alive, sacrificed to its Dark Lord.\\n\\n'Why do I tell you this? I tell you this so you will know I am no wilting flower. I have been forged of tough steel, hardened by fire and by the salt-spray. There is a reason Belondor was my first intended, for he is the same: made durable by his experiences.\\n\\n'For he did not perish beneath the waves when Sirgon pursued him through the rocks of Shedax Khîn. He survived as a castaway among the Shield Isles, sun-scorched and bitter, until he was taken aboard an Ordâkhai galley. In time he came to Umbar and served in the Fleet-fast, becoming one of its dedicated defenders, but the rule of the Heirs of Castamir rankled him.\\n\\n'He began a friendship with Azagath the Sea-shadow and others who would come to supplant the Heirs. This Kindred of the Coins rules wisely and fairly, unlike either the Heirs of Castamir or the Steward of Gondor. What final words have you to say, Sirgon? Will you beg the forgiveness of my husband? I will give your words to him, if they please me.'",

But know that I was forever changed by what I did to your husband Belondor, though I did not know it. But now I see that I was.\\n\\n'I believed I missed the sea, and sailing, and traced my miseries to giving up that life. But I see now that it was my friendship with your husband that I truly missed, and the innocence of my youth before I committed the act by which I am now forever judged, and judge myself.

Your words ring true to me. I have spent years dwelling upon my hatred of you for the treatment suffered by Belondor at your hands, and at the hands of Gondor, and though that land is ruled now by a King and not a Steward, I believe in my heart that it would be no different if those events happened today and not long years ago. I did not forgive you then, and I do not forgive you now.'\\n\\nMêshka shakes her head, and for the first time today you see her smile.\\n\\n'But men are weak, Sirgon. Know this: when the streets of Umbar Baharbêl filled with soldiers of Ordâkh and the Heirs of Castamir sailed with the Corsairs to Gondor, my husband Belondor weighed his hatred for Gondor against them... and he dispatched a ship for Pelargir, bearing a warning for you. I counselled against it, but it seems it did not matter, for the ship never arrived. No doubt it was sunk by the Heirs, and no warning ever came to you.\\n\\n'My first husband was a good man, slain by Ordâkh. My second husband, Belondor, helped to overthrow those who killed my first, and he established a new order in Umbar, the Kindred of the Coins, which will usher in an era of prosperity and peace. If he has any fault, it is that he forgives too readily, and is pleased to forget the sins of Gondor if it means Umbar will have a fresh beginning; this is not a fault that I share! Therefore I give you your life, Sirgon, but I banish you from the Upper Ward. If I see you return I will order my guards to slay you where you stand. Now begone. Our business here is done.'",
