That ring is gone, along with the others to which we held a claim, and none of them are coming back. It is not our way to give up hope, and our artisans will continue to strive, but I mourn the great works that once were made and will now have no rivals.\\n\\n'Thank you all the same, [placeholder].'",

Can it be their strength declines even now, just as the craft-skill of the dwarves lessens with the absence of the Dwarf-ring? Do the Gúrzyul seek some means of survival, some power to counteract this decay? It would explain Ugrukhôr's desperation, [placeholder].\\n\\n'If it is not a Bugdatish he seeks, not an artifact, but a Bugdash, a birth-name, perhaps he believes this information will stave off his decline. We must remain vigilant and keep the Gúrzyul from attaining the knowledge that will save them. This journey was valuable, my friend, though we defeated no Gúrzyul and found neither artifacts nor weapons. The wisdom we found is treasure enough.\\n\\n'I will ask the king to grant me a room within the Mountain and will retire there to consider our next course of action.
