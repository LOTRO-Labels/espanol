When word came of King Elessar's victory at Pelargir, the Corsairs here turned tail and sailed away fast as could be. We gave chase to some of them, of course, but mostly we were simply happy to see them go.\\n\\n'However, in recent days, odd things have started failing on the ships that are docked here. Rigging pins slip their posts and tightly woven ropes snap like yarn. I have begun to suspect that we did not chase all of the enemy from our bay. I wonder if you might be able to assist. I need someone who can discreetly inspect pins and ropes on the ship moored here. Someone who will not let whoever is behind this know we're on to them. If you can, I would greatly appreciate the help.'",
