It is not right that I should send you to wrest the palant√≠r from her clutches, when I am to blame for much of her evil. I will no longer shirk my responsibility. If I succeed, there will be no cause for fear. If I fail, I will have fallen doing what I should have done long ago: the debt must be paid, and if I perish in its payment, even that would be just.\\n\\nWould that I could see you in person and tell you why I must do this, but I cannot. Out of kindness and friendship, you would seek to dissuade me, and I fear I am not strong enough to maintain my course when confronted with such persuasions.\\n\\nDo not follow me, my friends. This is something I must do alone.\\n\\n-Laerdan",
