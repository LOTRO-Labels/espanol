You may eat as quickly or as slowly as you like.\\n\\nAfter this first bit, however, I'm afraid the pace must pick up a bit. You'll have a limited amount of time to run to each subsequent eating station and eat your fill... and it will only get harder as you go!\\n\\nThere are five eating stations in all, and only the most skilled eaters make it to the very end.'",
