The Kintai fight to preserve what we can among the wastes, even as the circle of our influence grows ever smaller; even the greenery that used to thrive now withers and dies, and the desert creeps ever closer. Much of this land was covered with a great forest in ages past, the Emerald Wood of Nisigím. The very oldest of my people cursed the name of the Great Enemy, Morgoth, whose servants hewed the trees and devastated the land, turning large tracts of the Emerald Wood into desert.\\n\\n'But that was long ago, and those elders of my people faded even before my birth. The work of the Kintai helped to restore some measure of the Emerald Wood, coaxing life from the barren stones and ensuring it could live before they moved on. The Kintai became a wandering people, moving from place to place, tending to the groves throughout Shagâna, but still they named the Emerald Wood of Nisigím their home.\\n\\n'Stories of Nisigím's beauty seem now an impossible dream. When the Empire of Ordâkh dried the rivers and came north, their invasion parched the land and caused a great drought that withered cropland and forest alike. A terrible blight befell the trees of Nisigím, turning them as hard as stone. The forest has now become Adagím, the Corpseholt, and we of the Kintai now name ourselves Avabár-kintai, the Elves Without A Home.\\n\\n'That has not changed our mission, friends, but like others who dwell in these lands we accept whatever help may be offered. If you will bring us sand-sifter meat and bird feathers from the creatures of Khûd Zagin, you will help the Kintai with their efforts. There is a coffer among the pavilions north of the water in which you may leave the items you gather for us.'",
