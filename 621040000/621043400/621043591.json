For too long, Durin's Folk had endured hardship after hardship, and it did not seem proper to dwell on such a sorrowful chapter in our history.\\n\\n'Where my own memory and experiences did not serve the tale, I enlisted the accounts of others, chief among them the sons of Fundin and Gróin, and by his own request, King Dáin. For this, they have my truest gratitude.\\n\\n'As a final note, I have laboured to construct this tale that the reader might see it through mine own eyes. If I should interject on occasion, it is only to make clear certain details or include aspects of the tale learned long after the war's end.'\\n\\nBeneath the foreword, you notice a dedication.\\n\\n'For Durin'",
