But, having done some cursory exploration of it, I now see that sending a warrior such as myself here was the correct choice.\\n\\n'My instincts tell me that the creatures within Mekeb-farak are not a mere collection of random foes. They are led by something greater. A captain perhaps? Or at the very least some sort of intelligent beast.\\n\\n'On occasion, I have seen Orcs walking this road and would hate to abandon my post or that helpless scholar Darri to their whims. It is for that reason alone that I cannot explore too deeply into Mekeb-farak. You, on the other hand, look to have some time on your hands and the fire in your heart to take up arms and slay the foe who leads the intruders.'\\n\\n<rgb=#FF0000>The Iron Garrison has created a diversion, drawing the bulk of the intruders from the depths of Mekeb-farak. They are permitting you access for one hour, during which time you may enter and exit Mekeb-farak freely to complete the tasks bestown upon you. \\n\\nHowever, after the hour has passed, the Iron Garrison can no longer guarantee your safety and thus will bar access until they can once again muster an offence to draw the enemy from Mekeb-farak.</rgb>",
