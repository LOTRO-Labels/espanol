However the ship it was on was ransacked by Corsairs not far from port. The ship has only just come in, and half her cargo is gone. Namely the expensive half. I am afraid Khôltekh's chest was among the items not found. Khôltekh has always had good taste, and it seems the Corsairs agreed.\\n\\n'I do not know what is in that chest, but I do have a sense of where it might be. Corsairs and smugglers move freely in the Umbar-môkh. Seeing as how those items were freshly seized, it is most likely they are in Deshûkh, the Blood Market. That's in Dil-irmíz, the Berths. It is an area rife with thieves, smugglers and Corsairs, and it is where I would go if I was looking to offload freshly stolen goods. I would start there.\\n\\n'Be careful, that is a very dangerous area, and smugglers are not likely to part with their hard-won treasures with just a stern word.'",
