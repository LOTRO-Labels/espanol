I speak of defeating the Guldur Orc who has claimed Balin's library as his own.\\n\\n'Thaguzg the Terrible is what all Orcs aspire to be. He is a beast in combat, with the strength of several dwarves, and he ignores wounds, continuing to fight no matter the personal cost. He is the most dangerous and deadly of enemies. I have no choice but to ask you to do battle with him. If he is defeated, we can reclaim the library and begin studying all of the knowledge it has, not just snippets here and there.\\n\\n'Return south-east to Mezel-katub and find Thaguzg within. Defeat him and bring word back to me of your success. You will want to bring an ally or two...we are the ones who started calling Thaguzg the Terrible.'",
