Portals to the Delving can be found in Ost Ringdyr and Dar-gazag. Controlling the dungeon allows those inside to remain there, but losing control of the Battle in the Ettenmoors means the enemy will be able to enter the dungeon and drive you out.\\n\\nCreatures in the dungeon drop consumables and other useful items.'",
