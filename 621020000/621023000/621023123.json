People say the Mordorrim are to blame, but if that is true, why have none managed to catch the cultists responsible?\\n\\n'I am not saying it is true, but there is no question the Mordorrim conduct evil, corrupting rituals. One of their leaders seems to be Agan-khô, a dangerous user of dark magic. He needs to be slain, but be wary; we do not know the full extent of his powers. Discover them, and then put an end to him so he can never make use of them again, and you will be rewarded!'",
