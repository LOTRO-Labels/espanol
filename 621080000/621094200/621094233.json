Their betrayal must have cut deep to earn the enmity of so many members of the Kindred of the Coins. Why else would half that body's remaining number pass the Umbari wall at my border in pursuit of them?\\n\\n'I deem Belondor speaks honest words, or at least he believes what he says to be truthful; the dwarf and the half-troll seem more guarded, and speak less freely. Which of these voices holds more sway within the Kindred of the Coins, and who do they truly serve? The memories of the Shagâni people are long, and we Ikorbâni who live along the river have learned to distrust such as they. It will take some proving to unlearn those lessons, even if they and we share a common enemy in Ordâkh.'",
