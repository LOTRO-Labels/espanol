In Thane Edric's fervour to protect the crossing, we have forgotten that our crofters have gone and our rations must be preserved for the coming battle.\\n\\n'In other times, such things were not a problem, but with the coming of the Orcs from the Sutcrofts, I fear that our easiest source of food may be at risk. I speak, of course, of fish. Along the river Entwash, we have a great many nets in place to trap fish as they swim downstream. However, the Orcs are a rough, vile lot, and I worry they have destroyed or befouled our fish and nets since they passed into our lands.\\n\\n'If you would, venture to the river's edge, and search the nets. If any fish remain, the men could benefit greatly from seeing them returned to Entwade.'",
