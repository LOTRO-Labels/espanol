It was a different town when the elder Mayor Goodnough was around -- his son was not nearly so rich, but other people were not nearly so poor. Everyone had work back then, but some of the workers did not welcome the new mayor's policies about working more, making less, and sacrificing comforts for the success and prosperity of Winter-home. THOSE workers no longer have work. But the mayor did accomplish one thing: a fine festival, for that is what brought you here! Such attention from travellers has made the mayor a very happy (and rich) man.'",
