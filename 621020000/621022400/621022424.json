It is a popular tale, oft-told in Gondor even today, for it is heroic and tragic in equal measure. Lord Egalmoth had the command of Barad Cúron, and his charge through the city into the invading Orcs is now the province of legend. He and all his men died in that sally, but when the last defender was dead and the Witch-king entered the tower, he learned of Egalmoth's other purpose. The palantír was missing. One of Egalmoth's riders had carried it from Barad Cúron, casting it into the Ithilduin lest it be claimed by the Nazgûl.\\n\\n'Like many victories of the Dúnedain over the years, this one was short-lived. Servants of the Witch-king found the Ithil-stone fetched up upon a rock in the current, and they brought it to their master. Gloating over his victory, the Lord of the Nazgûl used the palantír only once before bringing it personally to Sauron, as he was commanded. The Witch-king made contact with the Anor-stone wielded by King Eärnil, showing him that Egalmoth had failed and the city belonged now to him. \\qMinas Ithil has fallen,\\q the Nazgûl sneered. \\qYou look now upon Minas Morgul.\\q\\n\\n'Eärnil despaired, and he forbade any of his subjects or his line from using the Anor-stone. \\qIt is no longer safe,\\q he declared. The Ban of Eärnil would last for nearly a thousand years, unbroken until the time of Steward Denethor. It may be that the Ban prevented Sauron from achieving his goal of a corrupted Gondor centuries before he nearly succeeded... but I cannot say for certain.'",
