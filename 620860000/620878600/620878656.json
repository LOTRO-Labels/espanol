I followed him closely around the racetrack, and then...he just stood there, slow as a snail, while everyone else tore ahead! He came in dead last. I may have left my pick at that spot. Argh! My blood boils just remembering it!\\n\\nShield -- Next I thought Ottó looked to be in fine form. I stood at the finish line, cheering and cheering, waiting...but Ottó never came. I thought I had my shield with me then.\\n\\nSpear -- Since Ottó had performed so atrociously, I figured he would have plenty of stamina for another round. I chose him once more, and followed the racers along their path. He was winning! And then he lost. I remember standing on a platform and gazing into water, livid, and that was the last time I saw my spear.\\n\\nMug -- Signar seemed like a good candidate, so I followed him, and indeed, he did very well...until he got three-quarters of the way around the track. At that point, I went for a swim to cool my rage, and tried to drink when I was done...until I realized that my poor ale had leaked out into the water, nowhere to be found.\\n\\n\\qLucky\\q Jewel -- Finally, I chose Lar. He'd won nearly every time that my champions lost. I knew he would come through for me, when all else had failed. I don't need to tell you how that went. I walked to the bridge with my lucky jewel in hand, and contemplated casting it off into the deeps. I was so sad that I do not remember what happened next. I hope I did not toss it off!",
