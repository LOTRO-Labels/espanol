A traveller from Bree by the name of Tim Strawley came to Echad Candelleth on his way south; a craftsman he was, and he bore wooden figurines of exquisite quality that he hoped to sell in far-off markets. He desired to raise enough money to support his young wife, Nora, and he was enthusiastic about his prospects.\\n\\n'But the road is rarely-travelled, and a worry has been growing in the back of my mind ever since he left the camp. If it is not too much to ask, could you take the road south towards Hollin and check to see that he has not come into trouble? I am certain that all is well, but I would be more at ease if you would do this for me.\\n\\n'The road to Hollin runs south of Echad Candelleth and crosses the Bruinen at a small ford east of Garbert's cottage, where it rises steadily until reaching the Hollin Ridge.'",
