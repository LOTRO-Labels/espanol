It seems that Rivendell is getting nervous about the rumours they've been hearing about Goblin-town falling under the sway of Angmar or some-such, so they sent me and my lanky friend here to take a look around and see what's what.\\n\\n'Can't say that we know for sure whether Angmar is involved, but we did find a large goblin-encampment on the surface just a short ways north-east of here. Normally the goblins prefer to stay down in their caves away from the sun, so that's a tell-tale sign that something is wrong.\\n\\n'We've been making little forays now and again against the goblins, but for now we've got to keep an eye on this pass -- make sure they don't start heading west to join with the smaller tribes scattered about the Misties. Perhaps you would care to take a try at them in the meanwhile? There are plenty to go around, and it would give you a chance to determine their strength. I would also say the exercise will do you some good -- you are looking a bit winded from the heights here.'",
