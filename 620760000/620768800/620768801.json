Their basic bow skills generate Focus points, allowing them to use even more potent skills.  If a foe manages to close into melee, the Hunter's dual-wielded weapons are capable of dealing the final blow.  In fellowships, a Hunter concentrates on quickly killing foes one at a time.</li>\\n\\n<li><rgb=#FFFF00>Lore:</rgb> Hunters are masters of field and forest, unmatched in their dexterity with the bow. They use their survival skills to guide companions and lay traps for enemies. The coming of the Enemy has forced them to adapt these skills to use against new prey.\\n\\nThis class was inspired by Legolas, Prince of Mirkwood, a mighty hunter and companion of Aragorn.</li>",
