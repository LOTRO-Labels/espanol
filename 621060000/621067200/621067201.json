It was surely a trick of the dark that shaped this bear into a creature far more foul!\\n\\nYou should bring this trophy to Gaerion, a trophy-hunter and lore-keeper of the Dúnedain of Cardolan.",

He takes caution not to cut himself on the sharp claws before setting them down.\\n\\n'I have heard tales of these creatures... the lath-bears. When I was a boy, I was told they prowled the lands of Rohan after nightfall, clothed in shadow and feasting upon the young. These claws are quite a find, though part of me wishes you had never crossed paths with that creature.\\n\\n'Although I am no weaponsmith, I'd wager these claws could be fashioned into a deadly tool. I shall have to see what the others make of them. You have my thanks!'",
