What business could Egnir have with him? Ludhír patrols the northern road that leads to Fennas Dûr—to the Paths of the Dead. After the King pardoned the better-hearted of their kind, we thought the Dead would not trouble us any longer. How wrong we were! Ludhír's even had to shorten his patrols of late, since the Ruthless Dead now dare to drift further from the darkness of the Haunted Mountain. Why would Egnir want to go there? I have not known him and Ludhír to be particularly close, friendly as they are to each other.\\n\\n'I do not like this at all, my friend. Seek out Ludhír, and see if Egnir is still with him!'",
