One of those secrets is held behind a hidden door to the north-east of here.\\n\\n'It is an ancient crystal-mine, Kheled-menem, a place we used to gather up the glowing crystals you see throughout our camps. If we are to bring Khazad-dûm back to its glory, we will need this mine.\\n\\n'I have much to do inside this place; however, I will not trust you with helping me until you can find the door yourself. We dwarves do not give up Khazad-dûm's secrets easily, but I will provide you with a little help. Head north-east, beyond the Orc-watch and the Ghâsh-hai encampments, but do not venture near the Orcs beyond. With the purple dwarf-lamp you built, the door to Kheled-menem should now reveal itself to you. Make sure you check places you might have looked past with haste before.'",
