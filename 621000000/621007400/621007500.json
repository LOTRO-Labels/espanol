Yes, it was many years ago... a great spider, strong and cunning and filled with malice. Iphantemel we called her, and she was nearly my match. I was stung, and in return gave her a grievous wound. At that, she fled... and though I hunted her many years, I never more than glimpsed her. She was wily, as I have said, and laid many traps for me.\\n\\n'That was long ago, but such an ambush as Hállkell describes might well be her doing. Such malice against Elves and Elves alone I could also believe. And perhaps, due to the wound I dealt her, she was unable to flee with all the others of her wretched kind.\\n\\n'I know how we may test this hunch. Alone among the spiders of Mirkwood, Iphantemel and all her spawn crave the sap of trees, and drink it as you might water. Would you return to the wood and gather some sap? You will find taps here and there, set by my foresters. It is time that we laid a trap of our own.'",
