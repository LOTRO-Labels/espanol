It is the Lady's will that his artifacts be gathered to Barad-dûr that we might prepare for his return. The Great Rings he once held in Barad-dûr may have come to rest on the shattered plains of Dor Amarth. They must be reclaimed before the fires of Orodruin consume them!\\nThose who deliver them to Barad-dûr shall be made deathless when at last Sauron returns!\\n\\nHigh-priestess Khokali",
