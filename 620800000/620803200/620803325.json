She was the reason I became a Champion: her courage was unshakeable, her voice commanding, and the flickering of her blades was like the shimmering dance of moonlight on the Red Swamp. She fell in battle against minions of the Enemy, and the world has been a little dimmer ever since.\\n\\n'I took up her sword, which is named Gránung. I have wielded it as best I could in defence of justice, until recently, when I was travelling here from Taur Orthon through the ice canyons. I was ambushed by something -- all I saw was a flash of fur. Altti, a trapper, found me and brought me here, but without my sword!\\n\\n'I believe it to be still in the canyons south of here. Please, I beg you, help me recover Gránung! My family's honour as well as my own are at stake.'",
