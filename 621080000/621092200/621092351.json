Sickly, frequently bed-ridden, plagued by the Jin-ri, the Black Wind. My father bought that necklace to try to brighten her spirits, and because he was told it had healing properties. But after she wore it, I saw a change in her. She was a warm woman, always giving. But after wearing it, her heart hardened. Her words hardened, and stung as knives. She shut herself off from the world. From us.\\n\\n'I know not if it was the necklace or the knots of her mind, but my mother soon died after wearing that necklace. My father thinks it an artifact, a physical memory of her. I think it a cursed memory, and one that was better to have stayed lost.'",
