Well, I suppose someone like you does not keep up with this sort of thing. Too busy tramping all over the countryside being a hero and having adventures? Exactly the person I have been seeking. You see, I am exploring the ruins that dot the hills and forests of the Angle, but I need assistance in these dangerous lands.'",

It sadly has lost most of its function, but when it was first created, it would have indicated what the weather is in a certain area. They were an experiment that had been considered a failure, as one could easily look to the skies to count clouds. You say you found this in an ancient smial? What a perfect use for such a device! It must have been gifted to an Elf-friend long ago. Thank you for bringing it to me! I look forward to studying its properties.'",
