Upon completing an arduous challenge, the Rhi Helvarch blessed the amulet that you recently recovered. The marriage was not to last, however, for my father murdered my wife and sundered the amulet. My belief is that when my father slew my wife and broke the amulet that I had given to her, the curse unfolded upon us. Such an act of betrayal is what brought this down upon us.\\n\\n'Please go, so that I might regain my strength and summon those that would aid me.
