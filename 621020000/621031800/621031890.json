The kingdom's demise was sudden, coming only a year after the Witch-king’s final victory over Arthedain and the fall of Fornost. The chronicles of this time say an army of Elves and Men of Gondor, having come too late to save the northern Dúnedain, put the Angmarim to the sword and sent the Witch-king flying back to Mordor.\\n\\n'Why do I relate this story to you? Angmar's fall had an important connexion with my people. At this time, Gundabad no longer had the Iron Kingdom at its back, and the moors and glens of the Welling-folds no longer seemed so daunting as they had to Marhwini a hundred years before. Fram saw this as an opportunity to lead his people to great things.'",
