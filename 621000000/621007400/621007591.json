It belonged then to the bride of my liege, and disappeared for thousands of years until reappearing on the neck of King Thrór, as it should never have done. It was all I desired of the hoard. After the death of Smaug, the necklace went to Bard, but in his wisdom the Bowman took the necklace apart and gave its gold to the dwarves and the jewels to my people, and so were those bonds repaired.\\n\\n'I think the artifact sought by Ugrukhôr cannot be traced to the dragon-hoard, but your folk and the Men of Dale may tell you otherwise.'",
