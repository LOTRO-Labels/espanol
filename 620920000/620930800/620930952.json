My favourites are the ones about the Lonely Mountain, with the dragon and the treasure!\\n\\n'I'd like a dragon I think, but only a nice one, not a nasty one.  My good dragon would live with me and bring us shiny things to play with, and I'd fly him around in the sky!  Dragons are terrible clever you know, and so mine would tell me stories and teach me things that only dragons know!\\n\\n'But, you know, I keep thinking about that poor mountain.  Why, it's even called the Lonely Mountain, and that was when it still had a dragon friend of its own.   But since Bilbo scared off the dragon I bet that mountain is even lonelier.  I feel so bad for it some nights I just cry into my plush sheep, Petunia.\\n\\n'But then I thought about nice Mister Bilbo and I bet he feels the same way! I bet he went back to that poor mountain to keep it company!  If I were him, I'd bring it another dragon, but a nice one this time to keep it company for years and years and years! I bet that's just what he did!'",
