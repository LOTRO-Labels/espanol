      "en": "'Ever since the line of Kings came to an end with the disappearance of Eärnur, Gondor has been ruled by the hereditary line of Stewards. The Steward that sits now in Minas Tirith is Denethor II, a wise man much like his own father, who was Steward before him. Some forty years ago, Denethor married Finduilas, the sister of Prince Imrahil, and she bore him two sons. They are noble men, but they come rarely to Dol Amroth and I have not seen them in many years.\\n\\n'Finduilas loved Denethor, but some say that the tower of stone in which she dwelled was not to her liking, and she died after a dozen years, far from the seaside cliffs she loved.\\n\\n'Denethor dotes now on his sons. The eldest, Boromir, will become Steward when Denethor dies. He is betrothed to Lothíriel of Dol Amroth, a match some find troubling.'",
