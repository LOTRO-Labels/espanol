Instead we quit the war and sailed for home, and so were we robbed of our chance to spit upon his corpse; but not before he took something else from me, for my youngest brother died there in service to the Scourge. It meant we were near at hand when the uprising began, and when the waves receded, the Kindred of the Coins ruled in Umbar, and the Heirs of Castamir were only a foetid memory.\\n\\n'Tumúldo and I swore to fight for the Kindred, and fight we have, but I was not certain that Gondor would have to die until this day. Now, however... I am sure of it. The Sea Shadow hates Gondor, and he has chosen the manner of its doom: the Song of Waves and Wind will spell the end of Elessar's Gondor, and you would be wise to leave the kingdom before it does.'\\n\\nNakási falls briefly silent, as if waiting for Tumúldo to speak, but he is dead. She turns cold eyes upon you.\\n\\n'Today we were allies, [placeholder]. The next time we meet it will not be so. This is the only warning I will give to you. Gondor will pay for the death of Tumúldo. A thousand times over it will pay. Do not stand in my way.'",
