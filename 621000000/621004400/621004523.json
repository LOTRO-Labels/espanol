I spoke with Meriadoc Brandybuck mere moments ago, and he told me he desires to continue his research into the various properties and classifications of plants and other herbs. His interest is chiefly in those plants that can be put to use in his pipe, and he is always seeking new such vegetation.\\n\\n'It seems he has heard from other adventurers that the nerbyg and flies that inhabit Agarnaith sometimes pick up seeds from distant shores, carrying them on long journeys far from the pods at which they began. He has heard too that the spindly legs of bog-lurkers often catch on weeds growing out of river-banks, pulling them free of their moorings and carrying them long miles. Meriadoc has asked that you collect these travelling seeds and entangled weeds and bring them back for his study.\\n\\n'I suppose a botanical interest is sufficient for this purpose, and if it is not... well, at least you will be thinning the numbers of these creatures that might otherwise pose a threat to adventurers in the swamp.'",
