For my own part the time of deeds is over, for soon I depart across the waves into the West - but I have long been a storyteller amongst the highborn, and before I go I wish to gather as many tales as I may of those whom we leave behind, that we may sing of you and never forget the long years we spent here in Middle Earth as our home.\\n\\nAlready you have performed many deeds here within the bounds of Ered Luin, and no doubt you will continue on your path undetered, for that is the way of Heroes, is it not? Please come to me if you will from time to time and tell me of your quests here within Ered Luin, that they shall never be forgotten till comes the end of all things.'",
