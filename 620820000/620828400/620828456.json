He fears that spies of the Enemy may dog the footsteps of the Company which left Imladris some little while ago -- the Company which bears a heavy burden -- and commanded us to follow in their wake, lest some sign of their passing be left behind.\\n\\n'To this end, many of my companions have gone forth to scout the lands. It is clear that Aragorn son of Arathorn journeys with the Company still, for there has been little of note to see. They have lit few fires, for fear of the Enemy, which is good; however, one of my scouts reports that he saw signs of an old camp-fire south-east of here.\\n\\n'If you would, seek out that camp and learn if any other sign has been left behind which may reveal the composition of the Company. The camp-site lies far to the south-east, beyond Sâd Rechu, nestled at the base of some boulders.'",
