I have grown fond of Lothíriel, the daughter of the Prince of Dol Amroth who rules now in his absence. On several occasions she has escaped the watchful eyes of her guard, and come to visit me outside the walls of her city. The matters of which we spoke? Not war, nor armies, nor weapons. They were matters of love and of marriage, for Lothíriel is betrothed to a Man she does not wish to marry. Such things are a Lady's concerns, and I counseled her on them as best I could.\\n\\n'But now I must counsel her on these other concerns as well: weapons, and armies, and war. I echo the worry of Galdor: she must not underestimate the Heirs of Castamir, and the one they call 'The Scourge.' Lothíriel's father has been called to war in the East; but war finds her now in the West, and if either is lost there will be no hope for the other when the night has come.\\n\\n'Go to Dol Amroth and give her my warning. There is Elvish blood in her line, but it is no sense of kinship that drives me in this; it is the love I bear for the dark-haired woman who spoke to me of her hopes and her fears when the moon was high over the Sea, and banished sadness for a time.'",

Some say there is Elvish blood in Imrahil's line, but if so I say it is a good ways back and the Prince has done a good job of not letting it master his senses!\\n\\n'You may pass into the city.
