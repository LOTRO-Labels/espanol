This reduction in their numbers and their power would not last forever, but during this time the folk of Beorn were able to reassert their presence in the Floodfells, roaming the wilds more openly. In the Floodfells they built the village of Limlók, and it would be the most northern town of Beorn's folk.\\n\\nLike the overgrown bushes and tangled roots in the low-lands, the Bear-folk are at their wildest in the Floodfells. Today the town's thane is Runerik Knotbeard, and he is distrustful of outsiders, believing his own people possess strength enough to turn away any chance raiding-parties from Gundabad or elsewhere.",

If so, it would be home to the descendants of those Fallohides who did not cross the Misty Mountains on their eventual road to what would become the Shire.",
