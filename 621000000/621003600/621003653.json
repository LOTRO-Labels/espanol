Shagrat claims the last garrison tore itself apart over a trinket, but I don't believe it. Nothing's worth that much! Even if Shagrat was telling the truth, that Elf-warrior stuck a pin into Shelob and we haven't seen Her Ladyship since!\\nWe cannot allow the Hollowed to impede the search. Kill them and burn what's left of your stores, and then send your trackers to hunt sulokil in Dor Amarth. Nurn's not sending more for a week, so sort it out!\\n\\nOne last thing! If the Silent One passes through Kala-murg, send him back to Cirith Ungol! I have need of his...skills.\\n\\nCaptain Roglarg",
