The treacherous see only treachery, and so it was with Saruman at the end. He has his life, but I fear he will not see this as a mercy. I have cast him from the order and from the White Council. His staff is broken, and he will work no further plots.\\n\\n'But he has his life. He will remain within Orthanc, and think on his old designs, and mourn. But he will no longer endanger Rohan, and I think he knows that if Mordor does have victory in the days ahead, the servants of that land will not forget the treacheries he worked on his own behalf.'",
