It feels that -- after many years of hiding in the shadow of Angmar -- we can now finally strike back!\\n\\n'In this matter, you may be able to help. To the north and east there is a place called \\qMaethad.\\q It is a great arena in which those of troll-kind, especially the gertheryg, train for battle. Those who survive the arena go on to lead and train others of Angmar. Striking at this arena would deal a blow to Angmar's ability to raise and train its army!\\n\\n'To end this threat, we must first defeat those who are training within the arena's walls, then we can move on and crush those who lead the training efforts.
