I trailed the brigands to this ruin, but now I see there are mostly Orcs here....'\\n\\nThe Ranger peers nervously about.\\n\\n'There have been a few Orc raids through these woods of late, and recently we brawled a good while. Fear not, for I survived with nary a scratch, but those blasted thieves made off with my lucky talisman! It is a charm we Rangers keep for good luck while on the hunt.'\\n\\nYou ask him if he fought with Orcs or with brigands and he peers into the distance.\\n\\n'Oh, you know... both, really. There were quite a lot of them. This might go a lot faster if you were to aid me in this endeavour. You do look capable enough. All I need is my talisman, you can keep any other treasure we find! So, what do you say? Care to help me retrieve my lucky charm and slay some Orcs?'",

I will think on this, and perhaps wander the area further south-east, beyond the old hobbit-burrows. That is the life of a Ranger, is it not? Until we meet again.'",
