They are a secret, so do not tell anyone else. If you go fishing there, come back and show me what you caught. I would be very interested to see!\\n\\n'The first location is on a bridge in a nice, shady spot! You will find it crossing the stream east of Arwáth, the haunted grove. The second fishing spot is south along the same stream, and is also a bridge in a nice, cool, shady place! The third is a fishing dock on the Ikorbân, and is very far to the east. If you continue to follow the main road past the Wrackwade, you will eventually come by it. It does not have shade though, so bring a big hat!'",
