No one save the forces of Saruman are to blame for the unenviable situation in which we find ourselves, but I understand her frustration. We should aid her, if we can.\\n\\n'I spoke with some of the folk of Underharrow while you were recovering equipment from the blacksmith, and they told me a group of Orcs and Wargs have threatened the peace of Dunharrow. The townsfolk have been used to these foes lurking in the mountains, but of late they have journeyed too near to the towns for comfort. Dealing with these creatures will allow us to send two messages, one no less important than the other. The first will serve as warning to the Orcs that Harrowdale is not theirs for the taking. The second message is for Ellen Fremedon, telling her that she does not stand alone. Her worries are ours, and she need not give up the hope of survival.\\n\\n'Let us defeat Orcs and Wargs in Harrowdale, [placeholder], collecting tokens from each, so we may send these two messages. I also wish to see the Dark Door of Dunharrow. I will meet you near it, for only few would speak of it and then only in whispers. It fills me with curiosity.'",

Perhaps in time of peace he could delight the ear with tales of his people, and may yet before all is done!\\n\\n'I would ask for a different tale than that which concerns Isildur and the oath-breakers.
