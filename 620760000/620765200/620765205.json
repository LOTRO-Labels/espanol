The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.\\n\\nThis book was written as a primer in the Guardian's art some time in the middle of the Third Age, during the difficult period after the fall of Khazad-dûm. At that time, Durin's Folk were scattered and greatly reduced in number, and the Guardian's role took on a much greater importance as the threat of goblins and Orcs to dwarf-settlements beneath the roots of the world became more and more common. The dwarves often settled for building powerful strongholds designed to make the approach to their cities, impervious to assault, manning them with skilled and powerful guardians to ensure that none would pass unchallenged.\\n\\nWhile the book itself is common enough, the owner of this copy seems to have scribbled copious notes within the margins of the pages -- notes containing an experience and insight to the art that even at a glance exceeds that of the original author.

Still, old Gandalf insisted that I take the time we have here in Rivendell to read up on such things and learn my duties and all before Master Frodo begins our...Well, before we have to go. I guess I really shouldn't say anything more about that -- Samwise, you ninnyhammer, Gandalf will turn you into a toad for sure if you don't shape up....\\n\\n'Anyways, Master Elrond suggested I read up on that book you have there -- he has a fine copy in his library, you know -- and it was an interesting read, sure enough, but that copy you've got there seems more interesting by half, as the fellow who took all those notes seems to have a fine handle on how it really goes when things heat up. Pity about the missing pages, it looks like the best parts are gone. If you manage to pull them together, I'd love to have a look at them, too...not that I'm like to have time for more reading what with us all getting ready to head off to....\\n\\n'Well, never you mind that, you've got your own business to see to like as not, and don't need me bothering you with ours, I suppose.'",
