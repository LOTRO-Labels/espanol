Scout the camp and count their number. If you have the opportunity, destroy their racked weapons so they cannot threaten Renewed Hamât. We have enough to deal with in the Barkhûshim in Kûr Anzar. I will not have another group of villains move towards us. Gather what information you can, and then report back to me. Do not take unnecessary risks.
