This letter is for your eyes alone, and I beg you not to burden Gladion with the pain of knowing me to be a woeful, selfish, foolish brother.\\n\\nI have likely left Lamedon by now with a pocket-ful of gold, for I have gone to seek treasure in hunting bounties. I intend to put many long leagues between myself and Gondor. Travelling such great distance will cost more money than my farm could give me, and so I must lend my blade to a gainful cause.\\n\\nIt is just that I cannot bear it any longer, you see. Limril, you have never been mine, you will never be mine, and I am sorry to lay this burden upon you, but I cannot keep this secret within my heart any longer. I beg you not to tell Gladion, for I would never hurt him for the world. It is why I leave. I love you with no expectations, no hope, no alternative, and the reality that I cannot go on living in this way, with you so near.",
