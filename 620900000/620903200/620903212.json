I have asked my neighbours to donate food and shelter to those who have fled and left behind their belongings.\\n\\n'Many have given to the cause, but Giselmon is ignoring my pleas. She plans to host a large feast in honour of Reeve Athelward, an action she hopes will increase her own renown, as she values her opinion in others above all else. There are people in dire need of rations and she intends to foolishly host banquets for the wealthy.\\n\\n'Giselmon refuses to listen to me. She believes that I am jealous of her high esteem, and considers my request as a tactic to undermine her affairs. Perhaps you might sway her decision. Suggest to her that the nobles would view a banquet to be distasteful, and that a charitable donation would be viewed more favourably among her peers.'",
