I was terrified, I do not mind telling you, and could think only of escape! As I backed away, the twigs snapped under my feet, and the creature looked up -- it looked right at me! I will never forget those terrible eyes; like lamps they were in the cold light of the moon, half-unlidded but full of malice!\\n\\n'I ran, and ran, and only when I was certain that the horrible creature had not followed me did I stop to rest. You go back to Wistan and tell him he can have the glory from the hart, if he wants it. But I am through with hunting in those parts! With creatures like that slinking about the wild, it is not safe!
