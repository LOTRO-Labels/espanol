You can move all space out of a bag which will make it so the bag will not display except for when you are in Edit Mode. Bag 1 is the exception and will not allow you to empty it completely. Once you leave edit mode, this will save your changes.\\n\\n There is also a search bar on bag one that will allow you to find specific items in your inventory. Lastly, there is a Lock Mode button that when used will allow you to toggle the vendor lock status of any item you left-click on. This will allow you to prevent the sale of items you do not wish to accidentally sell when at a vendor. While in Lock Mode, right-clicking will leave Lock Mode.",
