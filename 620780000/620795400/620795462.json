Whelan is just a babe, so you can understand my worry: I thought a bird might have flown into his room through the window, which we always leave open a crack so the breeze can come in, and I did not want him to be frightened. But when I went into his room to check on him, I saw that it was not a bird at all, but a monster: a terrible, creeping thing hunched over on bony legs! It was moving towards Whelan's cradle and making a terrible noise in its throat.\\n\\n'Its intent was clear -- it meant to harm my child! I let forth a cry such as you have never heard and leaped towards it; I do not know what I thought to do, but the thing sprang out the window through which it had crawled, vanishing into the night.'",

I was still deciding what to do when it did something that chilled my heart: it began to sing, a shrill warbling above the sound of the water.\\n\\n'I dared not stay any longer, [placeholder], and came back to camp. But I want this creature caught! This will be my greatest hunt, even better than the white hart! I want you to walk along the banks of the Bruinen, east of here in the valley, and look for signs of the creature's passage. Return to me when you have found some clue that will let us bait a trap for it.'",
