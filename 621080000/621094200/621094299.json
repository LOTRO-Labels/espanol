She nods with understanding.\\n\\n'Yes, I remember now. When a Kinta enters the trance of Tróthul and is entombed within the Sarláshi trees that compose a Veróth, they become bonded to their grove. They remain there through the years, ever watchful but unable to affect the world outside. Can you imagine the frustration of remaining a prisoner for untold centuries while the land you love rots and dies all around you? Can you imagine the sorrow of watching as the River Usâl dries up and the Great Dearth withers the beauty you remember into a dead or dying shadow, with you unable to prevent or reverse it?\\n\\n'So I choose not to fade, and if that means I must remain ever-vigilant and constantly active, then that is what I shall be.
