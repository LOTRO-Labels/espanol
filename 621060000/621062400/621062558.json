While seeking more Orcs to find my lucky talisman, I remembered something: it wasn't the Orcs that took it!'\\n\\nYou ask him if he sustained a knock on the head during his brawl with whatever foes he fought.\\n\\n'Ah, you jest, my new friend, but Rangers like me often do battle with whatever enemies cross our path: and in my case it was both brigands and Orcs, as I told you before. No, not together, not at the same time, but one after the other. I swear it.\\n\\n'But I am pretty certain the brigands did not take my talisman, for they were frightened of the Orcs and would not remain in their presence for any period of time, I imagine. But you know who DID remain by the side of the Orcs? Wargs, of course!\\n\\n'The Orcs I fought were warg-riders, and they must've stashed my talisman inside one of the supply pouches borne by their horrible steeds! So you see, all we have to do is find the warg that carries my talisman! There are lots of them around here, [placeholder]. You should check it out! You'd be helping a Ranger, and that counts for a lot in the wild, doesn't it?'",
