All of Sharkey's best -- you and me excepted -- are occupied in the South. What we got here ain't quite strong enough to take on the townsfolk straight-forward. Fortunately, we've been given an opportunity. Orcs have come as far south as the Greenway, even! My friends say Sharkey ain't on the best terms with them up in the North, but some of the Orcs who've come south into Bree-land have been cut off.\\n\\nThese Orcs down here might be convinced to join us! Of course Sharkey knows how to deal with Orcs, and these scouts from the North are no doubt in a bad way, since they can't get any new supplies or warriors. This could be just the turn of luck we've been looking for! Treat the Orc scouts well and tell your men not to interfere with them, or you'll be responsible for them being dead and all.\\n\\nBill",
