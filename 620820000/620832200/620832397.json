This tome is an account told by a scribe of those brave Elf-warriors during the long wars against Morgoth. Much of it is a heroic epic, told in linnod-verse, describing multiple forays from the great city into the realms of the Enemy. As with all tales of those times, however, it soon becomes a tragedy; one by one the Wardens were lost, many slain, and some were taken and broken in the dungeons of Morgoth. Many of the tactics passed down to the Wardens of today began with this book, which ends suddenly with the tragic fall of the great city.",
