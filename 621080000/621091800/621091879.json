It means a lot that though you are a newcomer to this city, you take actions that are for the good of the common folk of Umbar. As you well know, I was a newcomer here once as well. It did not take me long to fall in love with the Umbari culture. The resiliency of the people, the bright colours, flavourful food, favourable winds, the blue seas... and of course, my beloved Mêshka, whom I can finally call my wife.\\n\\n'Whether or not you love this city as I do, I still appreciate what you have been doing for its people, and feel ashamed to have once called you my enemy. You are a good person, [placeholder].'\\n\\nBelondor takes a deep breath as his posture changes and his demeanour returns to that of the Kinsman of the Fleet-fast and Captain of Fleets of Umbar Baharbêl.\\n\\n'Speaking of your quality, I have another thing to ask of you, if you are willing. I am unsure if the kinsmen of Tumúldo Fierce-water are aware of his fate. Tumúldo was the leader of a clan, Morutágya. Smuggling has been the family business for generations. When Nakási returned to the city with a hostage instead of her husband, I don't think she took the time to inform their clan of his murder. Rumours abound, of course, but they are family and deserve to know the truth.\\n\\n'If you would not mind delivering it, I have written a letter detailing everything I know about Tumúldo's death.'\\n\\nYou confess to Belondor that you were present in Linhir when Tumúldo Fierce-water was murdered. He raises his eyebrows in surprise.\\n\\n'Is that so? I wouldn't tell them what you have just told me, or you may not walk away from the encounter without bloodshed. I've been told that they have a base of operations in the southern part of the Ilmabiri, beneath the Sail-haven.'",
