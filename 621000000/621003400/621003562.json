      "en": "When the great, mighty, and inimitable Lord Sauron first lay claim to the lands of Mordor, he didst reshape the slopes of Orodruin and form Sammath Naur, the Chambers of Fire. Deep in Sammath Naur, amongst the fire and the dark, in the forge of his own devising, the Dark Lord wrought the One Ring. The One to rule all others.\\n\\nLong in sight, deep in cunning, did He don the One Ring and with his newfound power made war against the Elves and therein seized the Nine rings, and the Seven. Then to Rhûn and Harad Sauron roamed, gifting six of the Nine Rings to kings and chieftains, yoking peoples and armies under his command. Seven to Dwarf-lords, in their hidden halls. Three rings of the Nine yet remained, and these he bestowed upon Númenórean Men, proud and tall, who had bowed before him well and faithfully since times of old.\\n\\nThen upon the pinnacle of Barad-dûr did Sauron stand, rightful lord of all. He raised the One Ring high, spoke dark words, and a wreath of shadow and storm were all about the Tower's top. With the raising of the Ring, the Nine Kings, all upon their thrones, were called henceforth to the Dark Tower and lo! they were become wraiths and servants of my Lord. One by one the Nine Kings abased themselves before their Lord and Master, for they were Nazgûl, Ringwraiths, now, and all marvelled at the One Ring's might.\\n\\nTimeless and changed were the nine Nazgûl; their old names forgotten, their old titles and reigns turned to dust. New names they would earn, for their deeds in Sauron's service. The Bane of Rhûn, The Woe of Khand, and The Cursed Rider did the Easterling Chieftains become. Their rings are Sâkhla, The Cruel One, Adâsh, the Foe-maker, and Orôm, the Warmonger. The Grim Southron, The High Sorcerer of Harad, and The Forsaken Reaver were the Southrons named. Their rings are Jûru, the Herald of Mourning, Mêbat, the Mirth-eater, and Khânto, the Pain-giver. And the Númenórean kings became The Black Blade of Lebennin and The Gloom of Nurn, wielding Sapthân, the Foolstone, and Nitîr, Terror's Sting. The Lord of the Nazgûl, who wields the sorcerous power of the ring Ûri, the Heart-stopper, was titled Witch-king of Angmar, and justly so, for Angmar quivered under his wrathful gaze.\\n\\nThus were the Nazgûl, the Great Lord Sauron's most powerful servants, made. Each in his own keep in Mordor they dwelled, and in Minas Morgul they gathered, a fell and terrible host!",
