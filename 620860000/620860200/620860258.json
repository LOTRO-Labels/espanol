These southern Dunlendings are not loved by the people of Nan Laeglin, and they survive here now as little more than brigands in the wild.\\n\\n'The livery that some still wear may be of some use to us, however. It is difficult for Men of the North to pass as Dunlendings -- doubly so for we of DÃºnadan descent -- but were we to don the livery of Saruman's army and skirt away from habitation, few would look closely enough to discern us, and we might pass through the South unmolested.\\n\\n'If you can manage to scrounge some uniforms for us -- preferably not torn to shreds or bathed in blood, mind you -- it may help us slip a few of our number through into southern Dunland to scout ahead for the rest.'",
