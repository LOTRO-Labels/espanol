This beast has two great horns, though only one is needed for our purpose. The horn belongs to the mighty Rockwithers. We think it is the eldest of the Thistledown herd. Slaughter the beast and get its horn. Together with the sinew of drakes and the heartwood of a great Leafcull Huorn, we will build a horn to call our brethren to battle.\\n\\n'To the south with you and don't return without the prize, maggot!'",
