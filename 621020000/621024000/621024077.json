That tower is called Barad Angarth. Our scouts have spied Orcs patrolling the very top of the tower, and when night blankets the Vale they have seen the flicker of firelight in the windows. We should expect some resistance inside, but I think they will be unprepared for our attack. Quickly let us gather what is needed and prepare to take hold of Barad Angarth!'",
