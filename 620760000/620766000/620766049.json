No dwarf can be trusted, when you have works of art or history that he desires to possess!\\n\\n'Go to Mathi Stouthand and demand that he order his dwarves to release Avorthal. If he wants war, he shall have it. You must tell him this: I do not trust myself to speak to one so dishonest without striking him.\\n\\n'You will find Mathi on the upper levels of Gondamon.
