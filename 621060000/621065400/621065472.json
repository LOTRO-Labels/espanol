I do not judge any who ran, or any who hid themselves; those of the Riders who did not pass into the Shire pursued the Dúnedain they found into the wild.\\n\\n'There are still Rangers in the Shire, and I know they will do what they must to save the hobbits from these Black Riders. But more of my kin were scattered across Cardolan by those of the Riders that did not cross the Brandywine, and we will need their strength in the days ahead, if they still live.\\n\\n'That is what I need from you and from Meneldir. I need you to track down survivors of the attack and learn how they fared in the days since my people were scattered like leaves in the wind. This will not cure Meneldir's shame, or restore his broken oath, but it may reveal the nature of his heart. If he bears any love for his former kin, let him show it by aiding them now!\\n\\n'You, [placeholder], are free to do as you will, but know that it will be of great help to the Dúnedain if you aid us in this, and I will not forget it.'",
