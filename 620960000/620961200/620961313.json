The new transfer process will soon become available for this world, and, for the duration of the event, free. (Until then, transfers have been disabled.)\\n\\nPlease take the time now to review which worlds will remain active (below) and to coordinate with your friends and Kinships for orderly moves to a new home.\\n\\nKin Leaders have added responsibilities: they should organize their Kinships to choose a new world and then move before the other members, in order for the Kinship to automatically re-form. \\n\\nFor more updates and information, please visit the Lord of the Rings Online website and follow us on social media.\\n\\nHere is the list of worlds that will remain after the server consolidation is complete.\\n\\nUS:\\nBrandywine\\nGladden\\nLandroval\\nCrickhollow\\nArkenstone\\n\\nEU:\\nLaurelin\\nGwaihir\\nSirannon\\nEvernight\\nBelegaer",
