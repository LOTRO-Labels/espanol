Most residents name themselves in Umbari, and will refer to places and things by their Umbari names.\\n\\n'For example: the Bay of Belfalas is Abamâtu. Corsairs are Garâdi. The Shield Isles that lie to the north-west of Umbar are called Zîrar Tarka, and the dangerous rocks that lie about them are Shedax Khîn, the Grinding Jaws. We will be avoiding those, I hope!\\n\\n'I never had any call to read, but my brother tells me that writing in Umbari is done from right-to-left, and vowels are a fairly recent invention. Huh! If I had spent any time in the Tor-gardens, perhaps this would mean something to me.'",
