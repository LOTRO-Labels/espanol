But we do have in hand something else.'\\n\\nThe Wizard opens his satchel of possessions and removes an unpleasant artifact: the Mask of Karazgar.\\n\\n'The Weeping Warrior dogged our steps in the North, [placeholder], and he inflicted much pain and sorrow upon dwarves and Men. But he does possess two useful traits: his reputation, and his absence. Of all the Gúrzyul, he may be the most feared: a Black Númenórean who moved with stealth, appearing out of nowhere to slay and torment before vanishing, leaving only the memory of a frightening visage, a masked evil. He captured dragons and brought them to Sauron, but it is long since he was seen in Mordor. Rumour of his cruelties in far-off Rhûn will have spread even here.\\n\\n'I think the spirit of this Watching-stone will know of the Weeping Warrior and his exploits in the East and in the North, and I think too that it will not have seen him in long centuries, if at all. Were you to wear the mask, the spirit would no doubt see through our deception. But if another were to wear it, perhaps one of the Khundolar who rarely come to the Vale, who is to say what the spirit might think? And if Karazgar were to bring a powerful prisoner to Gothmog, the very [placeholder] who has proven so troublesome to Gothmog's schemes, would the spirit not allow both of them access to the inner sanctum?\\n\\n'What has your friend Ayorzén gotten up to of late, [placeholder]?
