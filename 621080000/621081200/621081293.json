You could have come little earlier than this, of course, for it was the command of Hámisar that we shut the gates and not allow outsiders within the fortress while Gondor was at war. It was a wise decision, to be sure, but it has left me with something of a problem.\\n\\n'You see, when Hámisar decreed that no Temámir was to depart the fortress, many of my folk left their weapons lying about. There was to be no need for them, you understand? But now they are scattered all over Furukzahar, and whose job is it to retrieve them?'\\n\\nShegai looks at you with a twinkle in his eye.\\n\\n'Why yes, my new friend. You guessed it on the first try! You will be rewarded for this work, of course.'",
