Anybody who knows anything knows that some of them dwarves got mighty peculiar after losing their home in the mountains far off all that long time ago.\\n\\n'Since then, stories say, some of them been known to be a roaming band doing nearly anything to squeak by, and that would breed loose morals if you ask me! Assuming they ever had any to start with, can't ever be sure with people not of the Shire, no you cannot!\\n\\n'I heard that one of these dwarves helped Bilbo dig a complex of tunnels under Bag End, and he simply popped down into these at an opportune moment!
