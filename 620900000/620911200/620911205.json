I am of a proud bloodline - my mother is the daughter of the sister of Théoden King. My legacy must be bold and it must endure; I seek the glories of battle against our enemies and to protect my people from harm. The Sutcrofts are my homeland, and I am not wont to abandon them as readily as Éomer would have me.'",
