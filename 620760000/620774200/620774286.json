Your quests and travails have proven that there are some at least who can stand up against this lawlessness.\\n\\nIndeed, your story has begun to spread amongst the folk of Bree, with little help or embelishment from me, I might add - though I am looking forwards to telling one or two of your more interesting tales to this evening's crowds.'",
