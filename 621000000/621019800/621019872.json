I thought I might find you among the Woodmen of Hultvís, but instead, you have found me!\\n\\n'What errand brings you to this place?'\\n\\nYou explain that a Woodman named Atta was hunted by a creature called Úbil the Snatcher in his youth. You also explain that he has been fearful of leaving Hultvís for many years because he presumes that the creature still lives. Radagast sighs.\\n\\n'Yes, that name is known to me. It is the name the Woodmen gave to Gollum. You supposed as much, did you not? I had hoped he was forgotten to them.\\n\\n'After I heard the tales of the Woodmen, I grew suspicious and, as I feared, I found Gollum in Avabárg. He did not look as he did when you chanced upon him not long ago, but it was him. Perhaps if I had better understood the tales of the Woodmen, I would have realized how he came to sneak into their villages without being seen. The Ring was far from my first suspicion, and it now seems foolish to think it might have been anything else. Even so, I placed warding spells upon Avabárg, and Gollum was forced to abandon it. He fled under the mountains, and I thought he would not trouble the Woodmen again. Gollum must have returned to the vales after the Ring was lost to him, but I heard that he was soon driven out by Beorn and his kin. Alas, not soon enough.\\n\\n'In that time, I believe this cavern became Gollum's home. I have placed a warding spell upon it, but I think it will still be many years before the birds and beasts of the vales will draw near to it again.\\n\\n'Perhaps something belonging to the Woodmen has been left behind within... but do not remain here long, [placeholder]. There is a foul air to this place.\\n\\n'There is much to discuss when we meet again, but let us not speak of it now.'",
