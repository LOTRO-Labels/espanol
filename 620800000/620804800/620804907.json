Ill-tempered, too.\\n\\n'One thing that many do not know about them is that they are sometimes scavengers, when they cannot find fresh kills or are too lazy to hunt. They will eat carrion and gnaw on bones to crack them open for the marrow. Their favourite treat is norsu bone-marrow, and a norsu-corpse after a small family of white kantâ has been at it is far from a pretty sight.\\n\\n'It upsets the norsu and makes them more likely to move the whole herd further away. We cannot afford to lose such a huge source of meat, bone, and fur! Drive off some of the kantâ... there is only so much competition we can afford.'",
