      "en": "Things have been bad around here, friend, and knowing that you are a person of no small courage, I have decided to write on behalf of a patron of the Pony. His name is Henric Banks, and he is a hobbit of Bree. He has family in the town of Oatbarton, which is a village in the Shire. Henric has told me on other, happier occasions that it is quite a nice place. Well, he received a letter from his cousin Fenric talking about strange goings-on in Oatbarton, and wanted me to send heroes to investigate. I have enclosed Fenric's letter, seeing as he explains the matter much better than I could do, and hope that you will travel to Oatbarton to see what is happening there. Most sincerely and with wishes for your continued good health,\\n\\nBarliman Butterbur",
