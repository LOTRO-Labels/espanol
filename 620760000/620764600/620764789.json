The Cairn is in Fasach-Falroid to the north, in the territory of the hostile clans, and their scouts and warriors are entitled by clan-law to defend their land. Yet you must not shed any blood of these Hillmen while obtaining the stone, or the stone will be tainted with blood-debt.\\n\\n'So I must ask you to journey north to the Cairn, and yet you must not kill any of our enemies, no matter if they attack you or not! You will find the Cairn atop a high hill west of the north road, and at night the path up the hill is lit by torches.'",
