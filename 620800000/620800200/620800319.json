It is well that Laerdan's life has not been squandered at the treacherous hands of the Angmarim, but what have they learned from him?\\n\\n'I fear now the folly of allowing the unhindered passage of the Enemy out of our lands. But for good or ill that deed has been done, and now you must make all haste to Barad Tironn with trusted companions, for there lies the last hope of Laerdan. Once his usefulness to the Enemy has been served, his life will be forfeit, unless they have some other evil contrived for him.\\n\\n'Hurry now to Barad Tironn. My scouts have reported to me that most of the Angmarim have removed from that place, and now only a small contingent remains behind to spoil and lay waste, believing in their folly that we will not return. Speak with Forchon when you are ready to leave.'\\n\\n<rgb=#FF0000>This quest is meant for a fellowship.
