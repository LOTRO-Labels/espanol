As you may have heard, the Enemy does not venture into the ruins of Haerondir, for they believe it haunted. In truth, this is not the case. It is an appearance we keep up so that we may occupy this most northern look-out for Gondor undisturbed.\\n\\n'Not long ago, Haradrim set up camp just over the western hills.
