I am in need of an adventurer such as yourself to help with a birthday surprise for my uncle Bilbo. \\n\\n'When Bilbo decided to resettle in Rivendell, he did it in typical fashion as you may have heard - with a bang and a flash, disappearing right during his own birthday party!\\n\\n'In that moment, Bilbo instantly became the subject of many a tall tale, and increasingly exaggerated legend.  I know he'd be amused to no end to hear these stories, but I myself can't go collect them.   The next time you're in the Shire, could you do this for me?  \\n\\n'Were I you, I'd start at the Gaffer.  He hears most everything worth hearing and he will surely know who you should talk to in order to obtain the very best tales.'",
