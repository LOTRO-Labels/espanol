He was one who shunned the company of his own kind and chose to live far from paths well travelled. Still, he did have some contact with my people, and it is through this that I know of him.\\n\\n'He was a remarkable hunter, particularly for one of the race of Men. I would not wonder to learn that he had no small lineage of the DÃºnedain within him. In those days, before the Battle of Five Armies, the goblins would frequently come down from the Misty Mountains to hunt in the western forests and cause no little harm to the Elves that lived there if they could. Rather than avoid these raiding parties, this hunter would stalk them through their entire course, choosing his moments to strike with care and cunning. It is said that he became so adept at striking without warning or mercy, that the mere whistle of his arrow came to cause panic amongst the goblins and Wargs that he hunted.\\n\\n'Alas, the lives of men are short, so it seems unlikely that he still lives, given the weight of so many winters, but it is interesting to see that this journal of his survived. To an aspiring hunter his writings might be of great interest, if the remaining pieces of the journal could be found.'",
