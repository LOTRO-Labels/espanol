Members are always welcome, and those who wish to join should seek entry to the league by visiting Ailward Chubb at the Party Tree.\\n\\n'But the glory of the Inn League was not to last. A few festivals later, a surly, sinister dwarf made his presence known in Thorin's Hall during their own celebrations. This dwarf, JÃ³nar, despises hobbits and believes that dwarves are the superior brewers of the land. He founded the Ale Association, a rival faction of the Inn League, bent on doing more harm than good for the amusement of those with wicked temperments.'",
