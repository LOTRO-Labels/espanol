I wager the Oathbreakers have startled the brigands even more than they have us...there can be no better time to press the attack.\\n\\n'I will send word to Stangard to gather more support. As for you, fight your way into their encampment and retrieve the relics. These Men deserve no such treasure and will pay dearly for their crimes.'",
