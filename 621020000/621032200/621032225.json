This time, you can hear it as well.\\n\\nYou see the Blue Crag goblins emerging from the mountains. They look around nervously, muttering to each other. You hear a twig snap somewhere nearby. They pause, and pull out their weapons. A gauradan howls and charges at them from a higher slope. He bellows something at the goblins, but you cannot make out the words. The goblins try to fight back, but are quickly overpowered by the hulking beast-man. The gauradan notices the strange stone still clutched in the hand of the dead goblin. He begins to peer into it, but then winces, and looks away, disgusted by the foul magic attempting to enter his mind. Still careful to look away, he picks up the stone, and hides it in a pouch under his furs. He then runs off toward his village.\\n\\nIt is clear you must track down the gauradan in order to find the stone.",
