And yet, I know in my heart that we must take what rest we can, and cherish times of peace that we may steel our resolve for times of hardship. To that end, I desire your attendance at my wedding to Arwen Und√≥miel. The wedding is planned for Midsummer's Day, and stable-masters in major towns and cities should be able to bring you hither as that day approaches. I await you in the Tower of Ecthelion in Minas Tirith (Midsummer), my friend! Let us make the most of this time of celebration, for our recent adventures have shown me that danger is never far off, and a time of peace must be appreciated, lest it vanish for good.\\n\\nYour friend Aragorn Elessar, King of Gondor",
