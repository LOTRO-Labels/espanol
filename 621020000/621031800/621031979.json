When I was but a small baby, I crawled away from Grandmother Maddy in the mountain meadows. There, a ferocious wolf found me! Thankfully, before it could eat me an Eagle came swooping down and saved me! Since then, I knew I had to repay the Eagles however I could. Grandmother Maddy said she'd heard tales of birds collecting shiny trinkets, so I learned to mine the mountainside for gems which I smooth down into pretty trinkets for the Eagles. Since then, a few of us have even made the tributes together!\\n\\n'I thought you'd like to help since you know the Eagles so well!'",
