I temper my words of good fortune with a reminder to use caution when dealing with him; it is a reminder we both should take to heart!\\n\\n'Laerdan came to speak with me while you were away; he wished to know if any progress had been made in recovering the palantír. I told him of our military victories, but he did not seem encouraged by the news. We do not see eye to eye on this matter, he and I, but surely you must see that our successes in Annúminas are crucial for taking the seeing-stone from Amarthiel?\\n\\n'I could not ease his mind, and Laerdan asked that you see him in his room in the keep when you return. Perhaps you can make him see the rightness of our course? Annúminas must be reclaimed before we can hope to wrest the palantír from Amarthiel's clutches. We have time, [placeholder].
