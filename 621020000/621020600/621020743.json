It appears the spirits of the dead intruded upon the domain of the stone-giants, and in turn the giants destroyed the bridge in order to keep them away. No wonder the stone-giants that you encountered were so frenzied! I shall return to Grimbeorn at once and relay to him what we learned here. Thank you for your assistance, [placeholder].'",
