And that was right and proper, for it is a site of evil, and one should be wary of such places.\\n\\n'But now Faramir has returned to lead the Rangers of Ithilien hither, and I must find my courage. Indeed I have, for I see now that the known evil is less frightening than that which is unknown. I see that Rath Dúath is home to many varieties of noisome plants and fungal growths; this is nature, not sorcery! Some of the fungal growths spew deadly fumes, which certainly pose a danger to those who travel through the valley. If you come across any of these deadly varieties, destroy them! We will all thank you for it.'",
