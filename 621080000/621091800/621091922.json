There are many things to consider. The cost may outweigh the benefit. Speaking of costs, life goes on and there are still things that need doing in the Fleet-fast.\\n\\n'Traders that are permitted to sell their goods and services within the Fleet-fast are required to pay regular dues to be allowed to do so. When I am not at sea, this is something I like to do personally. It is good to be seen and to meet them in person, but the additional workload brought on by the re-opening of Dâr Laja has been taxing.\\n\\n'You would be helping me a great deal if you would collect these dues for me. If any of them give you trouble, I guarantee that a little bit of rough handling will convince them that paying you is as good as paying me.'",
