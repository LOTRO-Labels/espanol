      "en": "Since Sharkey's men have come up from the south and taken over, the local brigands have changed from being common thieves and robbers into something more like a small army. Dirty and ill-equipped though they are, by combining their numbers they may be stronger than any of the town guards. The Bree-land brigands of past times might have been crude and dirty outlaws, but they were still Men of Bree for the most part, with relatives in the towns and farms of the region, so they weren't all that inclined to heedless violence.\\n\\nBut now, Sharkey's men have changed everything. No dissent or squeamishness is permitted, and under their brutal fists, the brigands of the country have become far more dangerous. It seems that Sharkey's men are gathering their forces for some important task, and I am afraid they intend no simple thieving. It may be that they mean to take over all of Bree-land!\\n\\nI know little of these Men from the south. They are almost all ill-favoured brutes, but they are well-armed and skilled fighters. They do not trust the native Bree-land outlaws with their secrets, but they revere a leader they call Sharkey. I am sure that Sharkey is not yet in Bree-land, but it may be that he will come soon. Where do these Men come from, and where is Sharkey now? I do not know this for sure, for I have never travelled beyond Bree-land and do not know the southlands, but these Men sometimes speak of a place called Isengard. They come from beyond Andrath, maybe as far as Dunland. It seems from what I have overheard that they are rivals with some band they call the Iron Crown, but I know even less of this.",
