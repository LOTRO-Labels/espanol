Many groves of my people were abandoned, until only Sul Madásh remained unspoiled.\\n\\n'The Adagím of today is a nightmarish, boggy wilderness, despite the efforts of the Kintai. Some of us fled westward to Vartúlin, or to Shonith beside the Khûd, but I fear it is only a matter of time before the blight consumes every tree that once grew within the Emerald Wood of Nisigím.\\n\\n'Perhaps Inkanûsh and Cúridwan together will be able to fight it, [placeholder].
