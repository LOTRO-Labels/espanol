It will truly test how much you know about the Kindred of the Coins and the city of Umbar Baharbêl. But be warned: if you fail to answer a question correctly, it will be some time before I allow you to play again. It is only fair.\\n\\n'Here is how to play. Behind me you will see the ruined structure that was the Shrine of He-Who-Sees-All. The shrine is now mere rubble, as it should be; it stands as a testament now to the evils that the Empire of Ordakh inflicted upon us. To the south-east, on the left side of the ruin, I have erected a red canopy. There is a similar canopy to the south, on the right side of the ruin; that one is made of green cloth.\\n\\n'I will make a series of five statements. If the statement is true, you will stand under the green canopy. If the statement is false, you will stand under the red canopy. Return to me after each answer to hear the next statement. However, if you get one wrong you will need to begin my game again from the top... after spending a period of time mourning your lack of knowledge. Are you ready? Speak to me to begin.'",
