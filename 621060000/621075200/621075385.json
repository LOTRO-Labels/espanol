I'm not sure if he would remember you on account of his drunkenness when you met him. As for how we've wound up here... that is a long story. Suffice to say that my men and I could not extract any useful secrets from him, even after he imbibed all the ale you collected. And with the aid of some shared drinks, we befriended each other instead.\\n\\n'Actually, would you lend me your ear? I'm unfamiliar with Pelargir, and while my presence seems to put the residents at ease, my Corsair companions are also fresh faces to the city. Walking around freely would not go well. But after such a long journey, I was hoping to raise our spirits with some food.\\n\\n'I've heard there is a food stall run by Haradrim somewhere south of here, near the docks. Would you mind ordering something for us?'",
