I have seen them practicing their aim on travellers on the road below.\\n\\n'Now, I happened to get a look at one of these machines up close once - do not ask how, it is a long tale. In any case, there is a flaw in their construction and they are too much the fool to realize it. A single pin, when removed, can render the entire contraption useless! I will pay you if you sneak into their town and steal away these pins. Bring them back to me, that I might forge arrow heads with them, to be used to defend Lintrev!'",
