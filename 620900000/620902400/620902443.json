We tried to move both stealthily and quickly, and paid the price for it: CÃºfaron twisted his ankle fiercely, and cried out. Luckily, no Orcs heard the cry. Our minstrel Cuilinn wanted to tend to his friend's hurts. 'No!' we told him, 'wait until we are safe!'\\n\\n'But his concern was so great that he could not wait! It would be his very last song.\\n\\n'We fought off the Orcs, but it was unanimously decided that perhaps Cuilinn should try something less dangerous. He was going to see if the life of a farmer suited him better than that of an adventurer-for-hire. Certainly we may live longer, though we miss him every day.'",
