We must discuss our plan to repel them.\\n\\n'There are three passes into Fanuidhol: the Western Pass, the Northern Pass, and the Eastern Pass. We will have defenders at each of these passes, for if any of them fall, Lothlórien will be imperilled. But it is not enough to stand against the Orcs; we must turn back their assault and remove their foothold within Fanuidhol. Scouts tell me they have four encampments among the hills and have erected an idol to the Enemy at each. By carrying a Banner of Lórien to each encampment, your allies will be able to destroy the idol. You will not have much time to destroy all four idols, [placeholder], and will need to move with all haste. But beware! The Banner-carrier will be a very ready target of the Orcs.\\n\\n'Speak to me when you are ready and have gathered allies, and we will travel to the passes into Fanuidhol.'",
