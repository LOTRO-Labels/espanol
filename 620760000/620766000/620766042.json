There is a very real possibility that the dwarves have abducted Avorthal and plan to do him some great harm -- I want you to work with the bearer of this note to find and rescue Avorthal, if you can. If the Stouthand knows something about the fate of Cardavor's son, there may be fighting again in Ered Luin.\\n\\nDorongúr",
