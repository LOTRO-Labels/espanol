Say, if you're feeling brave, I've got a job you would be perfect for!\\n\\n'One day, I was enjoying a meal and a drink at the Prancing Pony, and I overhead a Minstrel spinning some tales. He told the story of a corrupted spring that lies deep within the Garth Agarwen, a fortress within the Lone-lands. It is said that a water-maid by the name of Naruhel resides deep within, and has fallen due to blood spilled in her waters during the wars between Angmar and the North Kingdom.\\n\\n'Within the swamp, there are a series of golden coins that were given as a gift to the river-maiden. Sadly these coins, much like the creature herself, have become darkened by the blood throughout the area.\\n\\n'As hope springs eternal, our hope is that you could cleanse this creature of the taint infecting the surrounding lands. If you bring me coins that bear her plight as proof of this deeds, I will reward you for your efforts!'",
