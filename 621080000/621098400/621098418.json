Tell me, would you help a humble craftsman?\\n\\n'In a land as unforgiving as the Khûd, nothing should go to waste if it can be helped. Over the ages, many soldiers have come to the Khûd, only to meet their end here. One would not have to look too hard to find their gear lost to time in the desert. For example, at the ruins of Shukabad, I have heard there are swords to be found, just lying about on the ground. Scavengers do not bother with them because they are rusted and unusable. They are still made of fine metals, however, and a skilled craftsman would be able to melt them down and reuse the metal.\\n\\n'It is easier to pick up these scraps than it is to mine new ores. If you are good in a fight anyway, as many of these metals are in dangerous areas. Should you be willing to face the dangers, go to Shukabad, west of here, collect any time-worn swords you find there, and bring them to me.'",
