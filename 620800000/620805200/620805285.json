I thought so -- I have an eye for faces, and never forget a name, especially one belonging to an adventurer! Of course, the more dangerous deeds you accomplish, the more memorable you'll be, [placeholder]!\\n\\n'That's what I'm hoping to do, you know. Once we get inside Khazad-dûm, Bori and I will become great heroes, and stories of our adventures will be told all over the land. Years from now, 'The Glorious Tale of Bróin the Mighty' could inspire young dwarves just as the songs of Durin and of Thorin Oakenshield inspire Bori and me today!\\n\\n'If you'd like to help me with the task my father gave me, though, I wouldn't turn it down. There are shadow-wargs to the south, across the bed of the dried-up Sirannon. Defeat some of the beasts for me, if you would; I've already slain one of them, but that's not really enough. May good fortune be with you, friend!'",
