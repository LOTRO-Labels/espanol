Hallways that lead to nothing, doors that do not take you back where you came, why, doors that would take you and I to different rooms. It is a cursed place, but an important one. The sorceror was a master weapons maker and those who have returned from the ruins have brought back sketches and patterns of fantastic weapons. Ones that could help us to turn the tide of evil.'",
