They were simply a nuisance at first, but you can see for yourself what they have done to our crops.\\n\\n'I had the crofters set traps near their homes a few weeks back, but since the goblins and half-orcs raided our fields, the traps have been of little use. If you would, travel out to the crofts and thin their numbers. Also, if you could place bait in the traps, we might find at least some success against these fiends.'",
