I am certain of that: look at how straight the lines of these runes are. These are of a style popular some few centuries ago in Ered Luin. It gives instructions for the making of a torch the likes of which I have never even heard! By Durin's beard, look at what it takes... why, this oil-coated base will be hard enough to find.\\n\\n'One moment. I have it! The Warg-riders sometimes bear similar torches, dipped in rock-oil: take one from one of them, and you will be one step closer to crafting this torch.
