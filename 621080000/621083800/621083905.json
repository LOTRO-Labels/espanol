The Ledger-keepers of Umbar BarharbÃªl now log actions and deeds, undertaken by citizens and guests of the country alike, into ledgers meant to weigh the measure and heft of the people's contributions. It may seem an intrusive and unnecessary effort, but in a nation once ruled by vile tyranny and secrets, the transparency is a welcome change to the populace.",
