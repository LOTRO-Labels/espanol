But this too is its strength: the Kindred itself is more important than any individual member. Were Azagath to fall during your rescue of the Gondorian hostage, that would be a most unfortunate turn, but the Kindred itself would survive... and that is everything.'\\n\\nHármelak holds your gaze but lowers her voice.\\n\\n'Azagath returned to the city in the grip of a curious superstition. Every morning he instructs some among his servants to carry empty bowls down to the docks beside the Harbour Warden's tower. They fill these bowls with saltwater from the bay. Once this is done, they then carry these bowls of saltwater through the streets of the city until they reach the bridge beyond the Fleet-fast. The guards let them pass, without fail, and once inside they fill the fountains within the Citadel with the saltwater they carry. At midnight, the fountains are emptied... and at dawn the process begins again.\\n\\n'No one pays attention to the servants who carry the water, [placeholder], not the folk of the city, not the guards of the Fleet-fast, and not Azagath Sea-shadow. Among these servants you could gain access to the Citadel of Winds, and whatever might befall then... well, it would be for the benefit of the city, would it not?\\n\\n'I trust this discussion has been as illuminating for you as it has been for me. Rothog will see you out.'",
