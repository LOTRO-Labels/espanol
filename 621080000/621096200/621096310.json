What once was Laithor, the great Emerald Wood, has been sapped dry, trees turned as bone and plants turned to ash. We now call these woods Favrathór, the forest of bone. But life still struggles to find its way, even within this dying land.\\n\\n'As the Artar Grove-tender, I am responsible for tending and caring for the woods around you. As you can see, I am doing a quite poor job of it. These hands, though still skilled, are lined with more than experience and slower than they used to be. But more importantly, the Lâg Dávrit has made all of us grove-tenders quite powerless. It has ossified the great trees of the ancient forest. We few who remain do what we can to combat it.\\n\\n'I have been known to scavenge seed, untouched as of yet by the Pale Blight. I plant it here in Vartúlin, that we might transplant these trees and bushes into greater Favrathór when the time is right. I have had good luck with finding unblemished acorns and berry seeds to the north, in both Shakhdag and Tir Katar. However, the beasts of the area have also suffered from the Pale Blight, many becoming sickened and frenzied. I dare not scavenge there anymore, for fear I shall not return. But I am no warrior. You seem much more capable. If you are willing, would you go there and gather more seeds? It is imperative to the forest that we gather and nurture new, unblemished life here in Vartúlin.'",
