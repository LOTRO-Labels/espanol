Perhaps if we petition King Thorin Stonehelm...'\\n\\nFastrith shakes her head.\\n\\n'No, it is too long a journey back to Erebor, and I know Stáli would not agree to make it. I would need to take the journey, and my brother would remain endangered by his master's whims while I made the trip. We need a more immediate remedy, [placeholder]!\\n\\n'Wait. What about that section there, where Eskil is obligated to nominate a substitute to carry out his duties in the event that he becomes ill or... maimed...? He still has all his limbs, praise Durin, but I would say he is indeed sick... sick of carrying out such dangerous errands for his master! But who can replace my brother in his apprenticeship until we can petition King Thorin to cancel the agreement?

Party the first: Stáli the Hewer, noted sculptor and artist of great renown, resident of Tumnu-dûm, the dwelling-halls, known herein as the Sculptor. Party the second: Eskil Bloodthumb, noteworthy accomplishments asked for by the first party but none were offered by the second and are therefore omitted; also a resident of Tumnu-dûm, the dwelling-halls, known herein as the Apprentice.\\n\\nAs a matter of course, the King Under The Mountain expressed his opinion that the parties enter into this agreement of apprenticeship of their own free wills, and that no undue influence was exercised upon either party.",

The meaning of \\qreasonable\\q for this section, and for any following section, shall be interpreted as \\qthe course most likely to be favoured by the will of Dáin II, King Under the Mountain.\\q\\n\\nThe duties of the Apprentice shall include, but be not limited to, the following responsibilities:\\n\\nOne (1): Acquisition of materials for the creation of any works of art required by the Sculptor, purchased with supplied coin. Any excess coinage is to be returned promptly and without fail. Upon discovery of such a failure, the excess will be tallied and deducted from the Apprentice's weekly stipend (see Section the Second).\\n\\nTwo (2): Thorough weekly cleaning of workshop space in order to foster creative work on the part of the Sculptor. Any spots missed in the cleaning shall be tallied and a percentage deducted from the Apprentice's weekly stipend (see Section the Second).\\n\\nThree (3): Timely preparation of meals for the Sculptor, no earlier than eight in the morning for breakfast and no later than six of the clock for dinner; drinks to be made upon request. The Sculptor does not like berries of any kind on his plate, but he is partial to honey and any products made from it, such as mead. The appearance of berries anywhere near the Sculptor's table will be noted, and a deduction made from the Apprentice's weekly stipend (see Section the Second).\\n\\nFour (4): Praise to be made for the Sculptor's work (when appropriate). Private criticism of such work will be noted, and a deduction made from the Apprentice's weekly stipend (see Section the Second). Public criticism will be noted twice, and count double.\\n\\nFive (5): In the event of illness or maiming that causes the Apprentice to be unable to carry out his duties, be they daily or weekly in nature, he is to provide a substitute for the day or week in question. If the substitute is found lacking, such deficiency will be noted and a deduction made from the Apprentice's weekly stipend (see Section the Second). Similarly, if the Apprentice is deemed to be contagious and refuses to nominate a substitute, that will also be grounds for a deduction from his weekly stipend.\\n\\nSix (6): Greeting guests of the Sculptor and assessing who is to be admitted and who is deemed unwelcome. The Sculptor's time is valuable and not to be wasted! Special consideration is to be given to those who bring gifts for the Sculptor, especially mead. The discovery that mead might have been given as a gift should the guest have been informed beforehand by the Apprentice will be met with disappointment, which is worse than anger. Disappointment in this case will take the form of a deduction from the Apprentice's weekly stipend (see Section the Second).",
