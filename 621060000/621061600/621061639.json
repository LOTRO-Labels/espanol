Not all of the Dúnedain will come with me on this errand, and many of our people will remain here at Tornhad. They will keep an eye upon the safety of the woodcutter and his family.

In times of danger, the village can be evacuated and we move our families to a number of caves in the outlying hills. It has happened more and more often in recent years: an unwelcome change every time, but necessary. It is a cause of sadness for the old-timers, and a pleasing lark for the children, but for me it justifies our caution.\\n\\n'What say you? Will you patrol these ruins with me?'",
