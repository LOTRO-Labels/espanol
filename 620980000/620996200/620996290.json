Mayhap the cause was in-fighting, and mayhap it was something else, but it was wise of you to dispatch a second force to hold the tower.\\n\\nThere are whispers. Others among the Gúrzyul plot your downfall, but you need not worry, for you have loyal friends. The Ghâsh-hai will stand with you, when the time comes.",
