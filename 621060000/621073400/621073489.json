The tool he bore was called Máltagar, the Fell Graver, and it was possessed of some unearthly magic. Whispers and visions of the Dead came to all who drew too near to Máltagar, and its wickedness seemed to grow as if it were feeding upon us.\\n\\n'It was borne across Bálach Iaran and we of the Trév Duvárdain followed the Iron Crown to Câr Bronach....'",
