Luhum-gêna stole my favourite hat. It was good in both the hottest days and the coldest nights. Close-knit, quite fine stitching. Just snatched it off my head, she did.\\n\\nIt was a really nice hat. I was quite fond of it. The manners on these marsh-lurkers leaves much to be desired. Teach this one a thing or two about the consequences of thievery. Find me after it's done. I'll find you a suitable enough reward.",
