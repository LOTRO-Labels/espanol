Although I sent Agnar, Lági, and Reithvald to aid my son in his campaign, I must admit I hesitated to enlist another of my father's old friends in the Kharum-ubnâr. Not because I did not think him suited to the task, but for reasons I am ashamed to give voice. But I have shrunken from my duty for long enough!\\n\\n'As I had hoped, Hersegg has sent word that I have been invited to visit her family's home at Vosh Torú. Whether this meeting goes well or ill, Durin awaits your return.\\n\\n'What say you, [placeholder]? Will you accompany me?'",
