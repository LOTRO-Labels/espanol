If you manage to achieve all of this, the greatest rewards will be yours!'\\n\\n<rgb=#FF0000>In the expert version of the quest, you will need to collect the Glorious Beer which will randomly appear on one of the tables. Be careful not to leave the arena at any time -- try to stay away from other players which may be able to knock you out of bounds. You will also still need to strike other players: simply target a nearby player and use the item.\\n\\nHint: Knock away a player who is going for the beer, then grab it for yourself!</rgb>",
