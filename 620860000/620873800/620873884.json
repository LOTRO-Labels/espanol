Often the latches to open the doors are hidden so well that they cannot even be seen unless you know of their existance. Unfortunately, the type of doors we see here are of the large, heavy, practically immoveable variety. If you were a 'brawn' class such as a Beorning, champion, warden, or guardian, you might be able to open these doors once you know of their existance.'",
