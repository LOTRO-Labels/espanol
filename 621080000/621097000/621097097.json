With him came we who taught the marsh-folk many feats of land-shaping and stone-work that they may harness the water and direct it. By the hands of Men came causeways and irrigation channels that run throughout the land. Like never before, Ambarûl flourished under the guidance of greater Men.\\n\\nRival kingdoms hungered for the abundance of a prosperous Ambarûl. The brigands of the wilderness could not match us in battle, but for centuries we did clash with Men from the east who waged a war of conquest. We were pushed back to Vëalondë itself, and Ambarûl was overrun. No longer needing the marshlands to source food, we chose to abandon Ambarûl and fortify our holdings. Thus was built Telperiën's Wall, Ambarûl no longer part of our kingdom.'",
