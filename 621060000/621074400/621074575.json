The Wave-hunter was harboured upstream in Pinnath Gelin during the war, to protect it from the Corsairs, and I have refused to summon it back here to keep Orgolas as far from its threatening decks as I can!\\n\\n'When I saw such a bequest had been made, I did not know what to do. But I cannot disobey the command of the King of Gondor. Hindering Golasgil's wishes was bad enough, but I fear for my son's safety! He is so young, my King. You must understand.'",
