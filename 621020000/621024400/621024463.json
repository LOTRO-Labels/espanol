I suspected that Sauron destroyed them when he came to Mordor in the Second Age. It must be true, as the broken glasses remain inside. Now that he is gone, we must restrain Ungwetári and her children. This is the first step to finally defeating the Spider-queen. Take the Gilgelair, and replace the ones that Sauron destroyed.'",
