I have found that my affections for a particular woman have grown into something I can no longer ignore. She is the beautious flower amongst the weeds. She walks in my dreams and the sound of her voice is a melodious tone that bards could sing about for the ages. Of course, there is a slight bump in the road. I have not actually spoken to her. I simply cannot muster the courage to approach the lovely woman, as I have only watched her from afar walking around town. What would I say? I fear I would only make a terrible first impression.\\n\\n'This is where my request comes in, for I have a brilliant plan to woo the woman of my dreams. Please, would you go and collect three types of flowers from all over Eriador... only the best for my sweet lady. Bring them back to me, and I will create the most beautiful bouquet a lady could want. I only need three varieties of flower for the bouquet. I will need a Marigold, a Violet, and a Primrose.\\n\\n'Marigolds can be found near the stone circle outside Michel Delving, violets near the stone circle beyond the Bree West-gate, and primroses near the stone-circle outside Celondim in the Blue Mountains. Take care and return as quickly as you can!'",
