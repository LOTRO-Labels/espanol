You take the scroll and begin to read it.\\n\\nThe scroll contains hasty writing which you swiftly identify as the writing of Radagast the Brown. As you read on, Radagast explains that a company of Orcs who survived the end of the War has now made camp at a place they call Lúlstrok in the Gladden Fields. Radagast's writing continues and he describes how until a few days ago the Orcs had apparently often feuded with the Men and half-orcs in the centre of the Gladden Fields, but they did not seem to pose a serious threat to the Wilderfolk. However, Radagast now fears they have been stirred by the words of a large Orc among their number and as a consequence, they have grown more bold in recent days. Troubled by the harm their siege engines might inflict on the Gladden Fields and concerned that the Orcs might soon attack the Beornings and Woodmen, Radagast concludes by asking you to drive off the Orcs and damage their siege engines beyond repair.\\n \\nAs the bunting remains perched nearby, you decide to investigate Lúlstrok.",
