Messengers and patrols move along this path, winding through the haunted ways of Imlad Balchorth.\\n\\n'Perhaps because of the dread of that place, the traffic through Imlad Balchorth is lightly-guarded. I would ask you to find the Angmarim patrols and messengers and waylay them, bearing back any orders they carry, along with any wealth in the form of pay-boxes they may be carrying.\\n\\n'I know this speaks of mere brigandry, but on the one hand, the loss of those orders may delay war-like plans of the Angmarim and Orcs already in the North Downs...and on the other hand, without those funds, their trade with some of the less-reputable merchants of the south and east may be affected, and their own men may be unwilling to move if they are not paid. So in this case, to be a highwayman may not be such a bad thing.'",
