Several packs containing supplies and other small items rest in the bottom of the boat.\\n\\nIt is clear from the distance to the shore that someone carried the boat here to hide it from watchful eyes. Several of the packs in the bottom of the boat seem to have been rifled recently. If you can find whoever did it, he or she may be able to shed some light on how the boat came to be hidden there.",

Isteron said he has never seen a boat like that, but he thinks it must have come from the land of the Elves, up-river. I have no reason to doubt it: it seems like the sort of boat Elves would make.\\n\\n'Another curiosity: these Elves went to the trouble of hiding their boat, and then must have set off on foot. But they left many of their supplies behind: food, tools, garments, medicines. Why did they leave these items behind? What could compel them to leave such useful items behind? And where did they go?'",
