Called the Nartáni, they were preceded by Elvish peoples calling themselves Tárthai and Kintai as well as dwarves of the Temámir clan. It is said they lived in the valley peacefully and in darkness. When Men awoke, the Kintai taught them much of tending the land. The Nartáni venerated a nature-spirit known as Írmu Who Weeps, whom the Elves also revere by another name.\\n\\n Aburûn was the first kingdom to rule in the Broad Marsh. In likeness of a wealthier neighbouring kingdom, they named their ruler Shâr. In friendship, Aburûn lived beside the seafaring kingdom of Umbru-mâra, for they were kin. Then came from the north and east raiders bearing weapons of bronze. Easily overwhelmed were the Nartáni, who were naught but farmers unfamiliar with warfare. Warlords took what they wanted from Aburûn – both food and people – and hewed the forests to drive out the Elves. Umbru-mâra then laid claim to the wetlands south of the Ikorbân, and Aburûn ceased to be.'",
