It mattered not to us if the Dragons had been sealed within the Anvil of Winterstith or if they had merely returned to the Withered Heath. Vethúg had long lain in wait within Thikil-gundu for the return of the Longbeards, and my folk did not know that when they closed the gates behind them, they wrought their own tombs. \\n\\n'King Dáin I was taken by surprise, and before he could raise his axe, Vethúg breathed a fell frost upon him. The ice encased him, and a swift gust of Vethúg's wings toppled and shattered our proud King.  Frór sacrificed himself to save the few of us who remained, that we might flee the gates of Thikil-gundu, but Vethúg had won his victory before the battle had even begun. We entered the Steel Keep in celebration... and we left it a broken people.\\n\\n'This time, Vethúg will not take us by surprise. Let us join the defenders of Erebor below!'",
