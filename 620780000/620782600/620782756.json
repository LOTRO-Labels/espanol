The evil power that has come again to Angmar would not condone such in-fighting.\\n\\n'The Iron Crown must have sent trusted servants out of Angmar and into the mountains, I guessed, to keep the evils within Helegrod mindful and under control. My guess has been rewarded, [placeholder]: scouts have reported the presence of three powerful Angmarim within the walls. Their names are known to me from the descriptions of my scouts: fierce Adhargal, cruel Grisgart, and unyielding Breosal. They must be defeated, [placeholder], for perhaps then the uneasy alliance within Helegrod will fall apart, and the problem resolve itself.'",
