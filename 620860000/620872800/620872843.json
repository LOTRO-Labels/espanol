When I came into my mayorship, I ignorantly put town money into unstable investments. I let go many workers, but the town is still in trouble. That's why the festival is here -- to raise money! \\n\\n'I keep promising them that the festival will help the town, which will let them have their normal wages back. But first I must use the festival profits to get out of my own debt. A southerner told me that there is a very promising investment to be made in a war that seems to be brewing in faraway lands.\\n\\n'Sadly, the festival didn't raise enough for me to invest properly, so I need to cut back on the workforce again.
