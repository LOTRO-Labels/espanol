Curiously enough, these giants did not seem to wear the tokens of the Thunder-lord; some new leader must have seized control of this group and sworn allegiance to the power that dwells now within Helegrod.\\n\\n'I have no doubts to the source of this power: it must come from the Land of Angmar.\\n\\n'There is one among the giants that I trust still: Arifael on Amon Nendir, friend always to the Elves of this valley. He has always forsaken his more belligerent cousins, though it causes him pain and forces him to live the life of an exile. Amon Nendir is to the south-west of the vale. Speak with Arifael and see if he knows anything about the giants that dwell above Helegrod. I fear that all the giants, save Arifael, are now set against us.'",
