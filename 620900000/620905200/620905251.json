Running more away than toward, it seemed to them as saw it. No one wanted to ride out to challenge them, and who can blame them? We lost Thane Pendrad in the Autumn to Orcs, and his widow may be Thane now, but she is not the fighter he was. And then to lose her son! It is a wonder she can go on at all, but she's not commanding troops. The Uruks passed us by, and we should be lucky they did not turn to raid the town.'",

Just the stuff. What did you say? The Uruks that ran by Elthengels? Aye, I saw them. Never seen Uruks run like that before. Even if Thane Mildrith was in any state to order our riders, she would have been a fool to send men after them. And she is no fool. Suffered more than her share of grief, if you ask me, but no fool. She was Pendrad's rock, before he was slain by Orcs, and she had much to do with shaping the man Pendulf became. Pity what happened to the boy, but you'll hear no rumours from me.'",
