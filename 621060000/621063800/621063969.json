Blanco it was who started the practice, and he fought many dangerous creatures and foes of our folk to keep the Shire safe. He never wed or sired any children, but in a way all of the Bounders are his kin... even the soft ones down in the Hithershire, who count on us to keep the worst threats from coming to their doors. And Bandobras, the Bullroarer himself... he's one of ours, you know, even though they're always trying to claim him for their own. He became Reeve of Long Cleeve, and eventually of the whole Yondershire, and I try to stand up to his example, just as my mother did.' - Reeve Rosalinda North-took",
