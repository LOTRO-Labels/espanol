You can put points into the Engineer, Officer, and Vanguard trait groupings. Each affects and improves your ability to interact with different portions of the battlefield. Traits deeper in the tree require greater investment to purchase.\\n\\nTraits are purchased using Promotion Points. Your total number of Promotion Points is determined from the highest lifetime medal you have earned on each quest. Bronze is one promotion point, silver is two promotion points, gold is three promotion points, and platinum is four.\\n\\nThe left panel contains bonus traits that are automatically earned as you spend points in each of the three different roles. These contain abilities and upgrades that can fundamentally alter how you are able to approach and play Epic Battle instances.",
