He had great victory at Fornost, when he defeated the Witch-king of Angmar, but that victory stirred his pride to great heights. The Witch-king fled; Prince Eärnur believed he had nearly rid Middle-earth of that terrible foe, and cursed his failure to end it there.\\n\\n'Years later, the Witch-king issued a challenge to Eärnur, now the King of Gondor, and summoned him to Minas Morgul. Eärnur went to that dark city to face his hated foe, and was lost.\\n\\n'We know now that his will was mastered, and he became the loyal servant of his former enemy. He took a new name, Mordirith, and was given the rule of Angmar while the Witch-king managed the interests of Mordor elsewhere in Middle-earth. Through your own efforts and those of the Rangers and the Champion of Angmar, he was defeated, but it seems that victory was not to last. He maintains some bond to his former life, and it allowed his dark master to draw him back before he was lost for good.'",
