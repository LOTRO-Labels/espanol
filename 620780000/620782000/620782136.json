It barters for roughly one-hundred and ten beryls. It's got a sturdy oaken shaft and hardened Elf-steel blade. With me on the job, it's ready to fight at any moment.\\n\\n'Now I know you are wondering how you can come by such a masterful piece of work. Well, I'll tell you: Valour. You prove your valour to the Free Peoples, and I'll see that you're fairly rewarded. No, you can't touch my blade. Your primitive mind wouldn't understand the relation of woods and alloys... things like magic.\\n\\n'You want one of these types of weapons, you will need to earn it. Return to me when you've acquired enough tokens of valour, and we'll talk.'",
