But I know this as well: we will do what we must, no matter the cost! We will stand opposed to all who threaten the safety of Middle-earth and will not rest until the Enemy is laid low and my people restored to safety and to plenty.\\n\\n'You are wondering why I did not tell you what it was that Gwindeth was seeking? That is hardly a riddle, [placeholder]! When I journeyed with Calenglad to claim the Silithar those long years ago, Gwindeth turned me aside with the rebuke that I was not yet ready for the sword to be reforged; indeed, I was not. How might events have been different if I had retrieved it at that young age? How might events have changed if Amlaith had taken it with him to Fornost?\\n\\n'We cannot see the ends of every road, [placeholder]. I withheld that information from you, for I believed that if the time was truly ripe, if Narsil was supposed to now be reforged, you would know for what Gwindeth asked without my telling you. It seems that on this matter, at least, I have been proven correct. Rejoice, [placeholder]! Dark days may lie ahead, but we will face them now with the light of Andúril before us and friends at our backs!'",
