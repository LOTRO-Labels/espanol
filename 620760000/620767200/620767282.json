Normally, we see no guests for months on end, but the glut of guests here has me stretched to my limit!\\n\\n'Anlaf is under great strain and takes his worries out on me, driving harder to see that the chambers are cared for, the workers watched, and the guests fed. Well, I'm just not able to do it all!\\n\\n'One thing that still needs to be done is the replacing of the pillows. All the stuffing's gone missing with the use they are getting, and I need to get the fluff back into them. We don't have the luxury of ducks, but the crebain circling about in the north might do in a pinch. There are plenty of the troublesome thorn-talon and sharp-eye crebain lurking about. Bring me some of their feathers, and I'll pay you for your trouble. The birds circle often over the vales surrounding Weathertop and the summit of the great hill.'",
