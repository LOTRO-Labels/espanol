From here we can keep watch upon both the crossing and the roads. The road going south-east is blocked by a landslide currently, but that will not always be so. People are working to clear it.\\n\\n'The Ordâkhai test our defences almost daily. They have their bivouac across the river, and though we hold the bridge itself, they watch upon the road from the other side, so we still cannot truly use it. We will need to clear them out in time, but for now, we are content to hold this ground with minimal losses and make progress on our fortress. Or we were, anyway, before hearing your news that they were frustrated enough to try destroying the floating bridge.\\n\\n'It would seem that the time of action is upon us. My best Dumûri are resting after a skirmish that lasted long into the night. You appear to be a talented warrior. If you think yourself capable it would be good of you to visit the Ordâkhai camp across the bridge and remind them that we are not weak.'",
