I and my hunters provide much of the meat we partake of during feasts and banquets in Lothlórien, though we are careful never to take too much from the forest's bounty.\\n\\n'Unfortunately, I have recently seen a new sort of creature about which threatens to throw matters awry -- a variety of large lizard that breeds along the banks of the Anduin. They used to be quite rare here, but of late their numbers have grown rapidly. Perhaps something evil has driven them from their territory upstream? I know not, but they are voracious hunters, and if we are to keep sufficient game within the bounds of Lórien's forests, then we must trim their numbers quickly. Will you lend us your aid?\\n\\n'It is unfortunate that Aesbrennil has not yet found a proper recipe for their tough meat, or we would be well-lardered indeed upon these beasts.'",
