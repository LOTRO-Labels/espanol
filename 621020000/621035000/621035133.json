We will infiltrate this tower outside Gundabad's main gates.'\\n\\nShe points to a tower on the map, just outside the keep.\\n\\n'We believe this is where they plan their troop deployments. If Gorgar intends to leave the mountain for any reason, they will deploy a number of guards to keep him safe. And he WILL leave at some point. If Orcs are to be kept in line, they need to see their chieftain in the flesh from time to time. I bet if we snoop around this tower, we will learn when and where Gorgar will next appear.
