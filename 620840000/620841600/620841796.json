We'd be out and about more if it weren't for those Orcs to the west. As it is, the safety of our camp seems to be more important than the money we could make by filling our bounties.\\n\\n'Of course, if you are willing to assist us, we have some materials that we would happily part with should you want to help us. \\n\\n'I am looking for turtle-shells to furnish the blacksmiths of Bree who often use them to create forms to fashion their shields from. You can find turtles all around the lake area here in northern Bree.'",
