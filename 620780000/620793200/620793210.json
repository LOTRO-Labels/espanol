I snuck in and took a basket of eggs when dad wasn't looking... he is very particular about his prized hens and doesn't let me tend them. I just wanted a snack by the river with my friends is all.\\n\\n'Well, after I snuck out the eggs I realized that they had chicks in them! Dad has been trying to get his prized hens to lay eggs for longer than I can remember; it must be the new rooster he got from Budgeford. I can't go back and return the eggs, but maybe you can! Dad hurt his leg and has so many travellers running about fetching eggs, you would be able to sneak in and replace the ones I took.\\n\\n'I got so flustered trying to get away with the eggs that I forgot which hen I took them from. I put the eggs in the basket in the order I took them, so all you need to do is figure out what order the hens lay them in. \\n\\n'I was able to sneak out a page from my dad's journal -- he can write you know, taught me all my letters -- though I can't make out up from down with his notes. Maybe you will have more luck? \\n\\n'Be careful placing the eggs back in the nests... those hens know what eggs are their own and will roll out any that aren't theirs, then you'll have to start over.'",
