If it is true that the realm of Angmar rises again, and its new leader serves the Lord of the Nazgûl... we are about to become very busy, [placeholder].\\n\\n'This is what I think we should do. I will travel to the North Downs, to see if there is activity along the border with Angmar. I will go with a number of my kin to reinforce the old city of Esteldín, abandoned for many years in a hidden cleft among the hills. If it need become a thriving settlement once again, and draw the eye of new foes away from other peaceful villages... well, I will make that judgement when I get there.\\n\\n'As for you, [placeholder], you have proven yourself a friend of the Dúnedain. I suggest that you aid the people of the North Downs and the Lone-lands, increasing your strength and the good you can do for the people who dwell in those places. When you have achieved as much as you can for them, seek out the Ranger Candaith, who keeps watch on Amon Sûl, the old hill of Weathertop, in the Lone-lands. Tell him what you have seen here, and warn him of the rising dangers that now threaten Middle-earth.\\n\\n'Go with the good will of the Dúnedain, my friend. May we meet again in happier times.'",
