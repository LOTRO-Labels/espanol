I am Brumbur, foreman of the mines of Járnfast.\\n\\n'I have heard tell of the many tasks you have performed in service of the King under the Mountain, but Erebor remains in need. Of what, you ask? Iron!\\n\\n'Indeed, Erebor is rich in many gemstones and ores, but it is nearly barren of iron. Ah, but these are the Iron Hills! We provide Erebor all the iron our kinsfolk require for their craft, and I intend to send more to the Lonely Mountain this very day.\\n\\n'However, Járnfast is in a state of disrepair and even now many of my kinsfolk work to restore it. If you would aid me, I would ask that you gather iron rods, sets of barrel-hoops, and pick-axes left about Járnfast. The tremors may have shifted them from where they were first placed, but I do not think they will be in short supply!\\n\\n'Deliver them to me, and it would be a great boon to our efforts to supply Erebor and restore Járnfast!'",
