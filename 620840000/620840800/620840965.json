We need not fear that Grawulun or others of his kind will return to that place.\\n\\n'But Gorothúl may have left other relics of evil throughout Moria; indeed, I think it likely, and recent reports from our scouts indicate one such location: the Mirror-halls of Lumul-nar. Merrevail have corrupted the mirrors of Lumul-nar that once fed light from the outside into the deep reaches of Khazad-dûm; the light no longer shines. A number of explorers ventured to Lumul-nar to investigate. Few returned, reporting that the merrevail of that place have been given great courage; their defiance is strong. What else have they been given, I wonder? A relic of Gorothúl's?\\n\\n'The entrance to Lumul-nar is on the side of Zirakzigil, amid the snow. Find the relic inside, if it exists, and destroy it. Bring one or two allies with you, [placeholder]! A small fellowship of the brave-hearted will be required to find the evil relic there.'\\n",
