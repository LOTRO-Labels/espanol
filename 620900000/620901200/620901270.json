Is it possible for them to set aside their differences and work together, as Men do? I am afraid it is. We must oppose them all, wherever we can. \\n\\n'During the Orc-ambush that greeted us shortly after our arrival here, I saw an Orc from Mordor carrying a high-quality sword. It was not of Orc-make; their weapons are crude and ugly, but this blade caught the light and seemed to shine as the Orc swung it around him in deadly arcs.\\n\\n'It is not right for such a weapon to languish in the hands of an Orc. I did not see this Orc after the battle, so he must have escaped into the East Wall somewhere. Find him and take the sword from him, [placeholder]. Many of the retreating Orcs fled to the north-east. Begin your search there, at the camp the Mordor Orcs have established between here and the Wold.'",
