Skirmish Camps have appeared throughout the lands as rallying points for those who will stand together to fight the shadow. Stout soldiers gladly lend their weapons, but they lack a leader. What hero will answer the summons?\\n\\nI beseech you to visit one of our Skirmish Camps and speak with its captain. Camps can be found in towns throughout Middle-earth, such as Bree, Thorin's Hall, Brockenborings, Esteld√≠n, and many others. Under your banner, we shall follow your command. Hope is not yet lost for the Free Peoples if a warrior of your class stands with us.\\n\\nI hope that one day we shall stand together on the field of battle! The skirmishes await your sword.\\n\\nIdhrinnion\\nSkirmish Captain of the North Downs",
