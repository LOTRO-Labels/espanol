Will you measure your fighting prowess against some of the dwarves I have chosen to join this Longbeard army? I do not question their desire for glory; indeed, these dwarves fought bravely and well in time of war, and achieved much honour thereby.\\n\\n'But their greatest deeds are many years distant now. These three heroes fought in the Sixth War of Dwarves and Orcs, but that was more than two hundred and twenty years ago, when Durin's Folk last set foot within Gundabad. The Battle of Azanulbizar ended that war, and our losses were too great to pursue the Orcs into Khazad-dûm. I do not doubt the bravery of these three! But I want to know they still possess sufficient weapon-skill to aid my son.\\n\\n'Seek out Agnar Brokentooth, Lági Helmbiter, and Reithvald Red-ember in the passages to the Dwelling-halls and to the New-lodes, and challenge them to battle. If they still desire to join my son in the Grey Mountains after testing their skills against you, then they shall.'",
