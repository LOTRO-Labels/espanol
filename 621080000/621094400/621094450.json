It was once a busy fishing village, but now the Ordâkhai have taken it for themselves and told me I must go elsewhere.\\n\\n'But to tell you the truth, fishing from the north side of the river is not so different. There are just as many frogs here as there were in Eshadûr. Ambarûli love their frog legs! I catch them using traps. It is much easier than chasing them around with a net, like a fool!\\n\\n'Speaking of which, would you mind checking my frog traps? Why yes, I am trying to get you to do more of my work. Am I succeeding? They are in the marshes of the delta to the west. Go ahead. It will be fun.'",
