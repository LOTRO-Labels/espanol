      "en": "Here's a list of all the picnic goods I misplaced while visiting the Festival today.\\n\\nBread -- All I know is that I had my loaves of bread when I left Hobbiton this morning, but by the time I got to the foot of the Hill, they were gone!\\n\\nEggs -- I actually recall going into the Grange to rummage for my basket of bread. When I left, my eggs were gone as well!\\n\\nCheese -- I did finally make it to the Party Tree to see the festival, but it was the smell of apples that first caught my notice. The Appledores were so close, I figured I would sneak over for an apple or two before starting any Festival games. Unfortunately, I was missing my basket of cheese when I left!\\n\\nPorridge -- I was of course very hungry by mid-morning due to having lost most of my food. Opal Goodbody was kind enough to give me a bowl of porridge, but I didn't have a spoon! How can one eat porridge without a spoon? I heard that Lobelia made off with many beautiful spoons after the old Baggins went missing. She didn't give me one, and we had a bit of an argument. I don't remember seeing my poor porridge after that.\\n\\nMushrooms -- I wanted to clear my mind after my argument with Lobelia, so I wandered across the road east of Bag End to find a nice picnic spot where I could eat my mushrooms in peace. There was a pretty little pond just off the road a little north of the party tree, and a willow for shade, and a rock where I could sit. But as I settled down, I realized the woods were wild! I thought I even saw a bear. I got out of there fast, but I must have left my mushrooms behind.\\n\\nI'm very hungry. Please help me!",
