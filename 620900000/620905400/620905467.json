It is a great shame what happened to her husband and to her son, but I am not attributing her words solely to grief. Reeve Athelward is many things, and I would never say he lacked courage, but the simple fact is that Cliving is far away.

I cannot say I would do otherwise.'\\n\\nYou tell Elfmar that you spoke with his father Elfhelm at the Fords of Isen.\\n\\n'I am glad to hear he still lives, [placeholder]! I would like to hear more of your account! While my father is away, I am trying to rule in his place as best I can. You have seen battle. Would you like to train with my men? We can discuss the state of things in Rohan, and you can tell me more of what you have seen beyond the borders.'",
