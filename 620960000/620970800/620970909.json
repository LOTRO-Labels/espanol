I neglected to tell our captors of my companion and dear friend, Lokhu-achi.'\\n\\nThai-chât's voice shrinks to a whisper.\\n\\n'Lokhu-achi is a Mûmak of sixteen years, and I cared for him after his mother was felled by disease in his earliest months. Lokhu-achi endured and grew mighty, weathering illness and battles alike, and he was to be brought into the war at long last. It was an honour to see him bear the brilliant armouring of my people, but those who rode him into battle did not make it far into these lands...\\n\\n'Their company was ambushed at Cirith Negen, and there they were slain to the last... save for Lokhu-achi. He cast off his armouring, wild in anger and confusion, and trampled all beneath him as he fled the mountain pass.\\n\\n'I believe he lives still, [placeholder], but there remains no way for him to escape the lands of the Rangers alive - not without aid. The Rangers will not trust our bond, and they will slay him unless he departs from here.\\n\\n'There is a pale root that grows among the foot-hills of the black mountains, and it is known to my people as marrow-root. When cracked, it gives off a strong, sweet odour to which the Mûmakil are drawn. I have seen it among the ruins here, and in the foot-hills to the east. He fled far to the south-west of Cirith Negen, but I know no more of his flight. Once you have gathered the roots and discovered his whereabouts, crack the roots on moss-laden stones and lead him into the marshlands far to the north-west.\\n\\n'I know not if he shall be left in peace there, but anywhere is safer for a Mûmak than the lands of the Rangers.'",
