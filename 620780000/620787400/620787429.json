      "en": "The forces of the Free People are outnumbered, and the might of the Enemy's forces is evident. A skilled warrior must not only defeat his opposite number, he must survive! To do so requires an Armourer to create defensive gear that can turn aside a troll's blade if need be! A skilled Armourer is both a Metalsmith and a Tailor, and can gather his own metals via Prospecting.\\n\\nAn armourer relies heavily on metals – bronze, iron and steel – to practice his craft.\\n\\nPROSPECTOR\\n\\nTo mine metal, you must do the following:\\n\\n1. Equip your Mining Pick.\\n\\n2. Find a Copper outcropping. You can use your Track Mines skill to help you find them.\\n\\n3. Use the node to mine it, and collect the resource.\\n\\n4. Take the raw ore back to a Forge, and use the Smelting recipes to create workable ingots. If you wish to make a bronze ingot, you will need to find a Supplier and purchase a tin ingot.\\n\\nThese ingots can then be used to make armour and shields for your countrymen!\\n\\nMETALWORKING\\n\\nAs a Metalworker, you can craft shields, heavy armour, and high-quality craft tools. While tools will often require additional materials, most armour can be made from a sufficiently large quantity of metal ingots.\\n\\nTo make Bronze Armour,\\n\\n1. Equip your Smithing Hammer.\\n\\n2. Obtain two bronze ingots.\\n\\n3. Find a forge.\\n\\n4. Complete the Bronze Armour recipe.\\n\\nAny young Guardian would be proud to wear such armour!\\n\\nTAILORING\\n\\nAs a tailor, you are capable of making the widest variety of armour. Both cloth and leather armour are available to you.\\n\\nRaw cloth can be purchased from a Novice Tailor, while treated hides will need to be purchased from a Forester or the Auction Hall.\\n\\nTo craft some leather Padded Armour, you must do the following:\\n\\n1. Equip your Tailor's Tools.\\n\\n2. Obtain two pieces of treated hides.\\n\\n3. Find a Workbench.\\n\\n4. Obtain one Spool of Rough Thread from either a Supplier or a Novice Tailor.\\n\\n5. Complete the Padded Armour recipe.\\n\\nAs you execute recipes, you will gain experience in your craft. When you are ready to progress to more difficult work, you can seek out further training and quests from craftsmen of note!\\n\\n",
