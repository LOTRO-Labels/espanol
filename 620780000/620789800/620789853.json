It is for the memory of great Elendil that I maintain the lake and protect the relics of his line.\\n\\n'At the behest of Amlaith, the last king to sit enthroned in Annúminas, I permitted the waters of Nenuial to wash over the walls of the city, and the treasures of proud Elendil now sleep soundly in the watery half-light. The adamant you seek, the Silithar that passed from Gil-galad to Elendil and his line through the safe-keeping of Círdan the Shipwright, cannot be reclaimed without my permission. It was the will of Amlaith that the Silithar be kept safe, even from those of Elendil's line, for fear that its light would be wasted unduly or the stone taken by the Enemy.\\n\\n'The islands of Tyl Ruinen have been overrun by salamanders, corrupted beasts that singe the grasses and taint the waters of Nenuial. Swim north-east to Tyl Ruinen in the centre of the lake and defeat the salamanders you find there. Perhaps when you return, I will have proof of the worthiness of Aragorn son of Arathorn through his messenger.'",
