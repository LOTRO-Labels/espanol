Transla...\\n\\n'Before the Years of Joy were the Dire Days. It was chaos in the valley and Gondor ruled and all lands west of Telperiën's Wall. Our people suffered and starved as crops failed... brigands... while Gondor did naught but repair their wall. After... years of ...and woe, a lord came into power up the river and united the folk of the Ikorbân under one banner. Thus was born the great Shârate of Hamât, our first true kingdom since the First Age. Ambarûl was among the first to join the realm. The Shâr slew the great champions of Khand, Gondor, and the southern realm in battle. Then he set aside his sword and declared himself a man of peace. Alliances with the lands he had defeated in battle, including Gondor, were forged, and Hamât grew to be all of Shagâna north of the River Usâl, save Umbar.\\n\\nThese were the Years of Joy, a time of peace. Trade, learning, and art bloomed. The bridge in Iridír was built, and the Road of Riches repaired. The dwarves returned at last, drawn by commerce. The Kintai, too, walked the woodlands with us, and helped to restore fields and fens that had wasted during the Dire Days.'",
