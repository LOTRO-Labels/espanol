The chief feature of the annual festival is a great feast where we dine on roast boar and drink the richest of ale. The only problem is that I've lost the boar-meat.\\n\\n'I had it hanging and drying just a few feet away from here. I had coated it with my special blend of seasonings...this was going to be a Yule feast none would soon forget. I taste-tested a little too much of the ale, I think, and took a short nap. When I awoke, the boar-meat was gone, and I could see wolf tracks heading west.\\n\\n'I think the wolves dragged the meat towards their den! Please bring it back to me, if you can salvage it...we cannot have a true Yule feast without it.'",
