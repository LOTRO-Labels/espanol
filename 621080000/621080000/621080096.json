I have need of a practised Mariner's assistance for an expedition onto the Mirrormere. If you wish to aid me, you can find me at Mekhem-bizru in the Dimrill Dale, but beware the Orcs that lurk in Azanulbizar of old. Do not keep me waiting; I will set sail without you if I must!\\n\\nByrski Hardprow",
