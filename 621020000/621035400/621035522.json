You see, digging the mines in Járnfast is not that different from building a bridge. In fact I build bridges over chasms in the mines all of the time!\\n\\n'Indeed, I consider it an honour to oversee the building of these temporary bridges and put my skills to good use! Now that we are able to safely set foot in Elderslade, there is another matter that needs attending. The road ahead is dangerous, for landslides seem numerous around here! Would you be able to tend to the road, and clear it of debris so that the path is once again safe for those who travel further west? If I had more time, I would investigate these landslides, for I believe something is causing them!'",
