Now, we learn that the dark tower standing amidst the forces within the forsaken valley to our south teems with enemies long kindling flames from a place I shall not speak of.\\n\\n'It falls to you, [placeholder], to gather your allies and make an assault on Barad Gúlaran, to stand against the horrors awakened within that dark citadel. One horror, Wisdán, once a man in service to Angmar, sacrificed his life to watch over Barad Gúlaran. Lore-masters dispatched from Esteldín brought us all we know of him and Barad Gúlaran. Little is known beyond his service to the Witch-king and his close ties with the Shadow in the North. It is possible that he is a sorcerer, like a few others within Barad Gúlaran.\\n\\n'He must be slain, [placeholder], lest his darkness be used to spread evil towards the south to become the bane of all. Gather your allies together and enter Barad Gúlaran. Return to me when you have done the deed, and I will see that the Council's gifts are bestowed upon you.'",
