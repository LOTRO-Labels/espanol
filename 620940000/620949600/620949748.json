This business with Tingobel occupies much of my time as of late... and the tales I hear of the day the Orcs attacked have only grown stranger. Some people speak as if the Dead were there in Tingobel, lurking in the mine just as the Orcs arrived. Yet, I only see Orcs dressed in bones hoping to prey on those very fears.\\n\\n'As much as I doubt their tales, I would ask that you search the mine. Hopefully that will finally put their fears to rest.'",
