When next he speaks, his face is grim.\\n\\n'I think Mazog was speaking the truth, my friend. I do not know very much about the War of the Orcs and the Dwarves, but I do know this: the son of Azog would not abandon the rule of Moria unless he believed it would become unfit even for his own kind. Years ago, his brother led the Orc army to Erebor, and died there. Mazog is the only surviving heir of Azog, and would consider rule of Moria his birth-right. Only a great terror like Gwathnor, or several of the Caeryg, could devastate Moria in such a way that Mazog would be disinterested in controlling it.\\n\\n'What you have told me truly came from the Orc leader?'",
