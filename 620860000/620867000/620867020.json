This means even though another player is in the same area as you, you may not be able to interact with them. However, you are able to transfer to another layer by joining a fellowship. Once in the fellowship you can transfer to the same layer as the leader of your fellowship by clicking on the Dynamic Layer Alert in the lower right hand corner of the screen.",
