Seven centuries into the Second Age, the great Elf-smith Celebrimbor journeyed from Lindon to dwell in the holly-forests at the foot of the Misty Mountains. That realm came to be known as Eregion, and it was the birthplace of many great works and treasures of craft.\\n\\n'The heart of Celebrimbor's realm lay to the south of the Loudwater, but the Elves drove out the trolls and hostile Amonedain in between, constructing outposts in the wooded hills on the border-marches. The chief of these was this stronghold, Eitheldir, built to watch the crossings of the Hoarwell and to keep open the road to Lindon.\\n\\n'The governance of the keep was given to Oranoril, a Noldor companion of Celebrimbor. She had served as a captain in the wars against Morgoth, and was renowned for both her loyalty and her ferocity.'",

At the Hollin Ridge she watched with horror as Sauron's forces marched behind the ghastly banner they had made of the once-proud Elf-smith.\\n\\n'Knowing a similar fate awaited her if she was caught, Oranoril devised a scheme to save what of her people she could. She chose a small force from her own household and tricked Sauron's army into pursuing them. On a grim chase she led them across the Bruinen into the Angle, while the bulk of her kindred escaped by secret paths into the mountains and then to Elrond's young refuge. Ravaedron was one of these, and he never forgot his last sight of Oranoril's company disappearing over the ridge, pursued by Sauron's foot-soldiers.'",

A brief siege followed, but the Orcs far outnumbered the few Elves that remained; the gates were broken and the keep razed. One by one the companions of Oranoril perished, until only she and three others remained.\\n\\n'Together they performed one last act of defiance, fighting their way through the throng to Celebrimbor's body and prizing it from the clutches of the Orcs. With her last dying strength Oranoril, now the last living Elf in Eitheldir, took up the smith's corpse and leapt from the precipice into the foaming waters of the Hoarwell. And so even in his victory Sauron was robbed of his trophies, and his anger was without match.\\n\\n'Furious that many of the Noldor had eluded him, and unable to find where they had fled, Sauron invaded Eriador from the Angle, intending to crush the realm of Lindon. Instead he found the Men of Númenor waiting for him, for they had answered the call of Gil-galad, and the combined forces of Elves and Men broke Sauron's strength. From whence came the final blow? Why, it came from Elrond and the folk of Imladris, for when their strength was recovered they returned with a fire in their hearts and Sauron could not stand against them. Defeated, it was his turn to flee; to Mordor he escaped.'",

Eregion remained desolate after the War of the Elves and Sauron, its shattered halls crumbling with the passage of the years, becoming overgrown with grass and vine, but the stones remember what transpired, and so do those who were there.\\n\\n'This is why I do not gainsay Ravaedron his choice to leave Middle-earth.
