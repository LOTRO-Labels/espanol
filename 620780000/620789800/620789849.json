She did not hesitate to rebuke him when he and I encountered her almost sixty years ago; I have no doubt that she would do so again, if it was in her mind.\\n\\n'Speak to her with respect and do not seek to hide anything from her! The Blue Lady has lived in these lands for years uncounted, and she had patience only for the kings of Annúminas. It is said that Elendil consulted her often on various matters, and she grieved his passing.\\n\\n'She lives at Gwindethrond, a cave in Western Emyn Uial, behind a clear waterfall that pours from the heights and feeds a shady pool at Rushingdale. You will need to circle the lake, for the pool is tucked among the hills on the far side of Nenuial. It will be a long journey, for Rushingdale is on the far side of Nenuial, west and slightly south even of Tinnudir and Tyl Ruinen.'",
