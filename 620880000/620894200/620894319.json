Take pride in your ability to hold your ground and vex your enemies. In the field of battle, your allies will come to value your fearless ability to stand and face whatever the Enemy throws at you.\\n\\nYou will need to do more than swing a sword to truly fill your role as a Guardian. You must threaten your enemies to keep their focus upon you while your more vulnerable allies attack from behind or from afar. A quick bash of your shield is generally enough to get a foe's attention for a few moments. The true test of a Guardian's skill is keeping that attention. Pay special heed to your abilities to generate threat. Some may not do as much damage as other skills, but often maintaining threat is what wins battles.\\n\\n If it comes down to it, do not be afraid to challenge an enemy. Be ready to counter that foe when he fails to hit you. It is up to you to turn the tide of battle.\\n\\n-T.",
