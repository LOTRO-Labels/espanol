Blasted, brittle, low-quality steel.\\n\\n'I am going to need another sword -- something decent. There are more of those wild men along the shore-line, towards that pretty little shrine the Lossoth have. I will wager one of them would have a blade worth wielding! It seems only fair, as they tried to rob me of mine, that I should rob them of theirs.
