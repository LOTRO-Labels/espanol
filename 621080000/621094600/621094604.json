It is my duty, and that of my Dumûri, to defend this land from the tyranny of our oppressors from the Southern Empire of Ordâkh. I have heard that you from other lands call us all \\qHaradrim\\q, as though we are one people, but that is not so.\\n\\n'Over one hundred years ago the Ordâkhai swept through Shagâna, conquering land after land and subjugating the native peoples. For generations, they have demanded our servility. They profit from our labour and steal our sons and husbands, sending them into war.'\\n\\nAs she lifts her chin, you can see anger, grief, and defiance in the woman's eyes.\\n\\n'But no more. Never again. If you wish to speak to me, you must prove you are not our enemy. To the north, on the west side of the stream that runs through Iridír, you will find a camp of Ordâkhai soldiers who have thus far managed to escape our wrath. Go there and defeat them. Bring me proof that you have defeated at least eight, and I will speak with you further.'",
