It takes you a moment to reconcile what has changed, but held in the grip of the spirit it is impossible to tell how long the moment might have been. The prison stands in the shadow of Orodruin, and then you see it: the southern slope of the Mountain is intact; the Ghâshghurm has not yet been made.\\n\\nThe images flicker behind your eyes, and you see that Naerband is filled with prisoners. Downtrodden Nurnhoth, rebellious Easterlings, and Haradrim deserters rattle the cages of their cells. Their jailors walk the corridors of Naerband, and they tap their weapons on the iron doors, and they scrape their blades on the iron walls, and they tap their boots on the iron floor. You are seized by a sensation of eager anticipation, but it does not belong to you. It comes from the whispering spirit, and fills you with revulsion and dread.\\n\\nThen the Mountain blazes, and the southern slope explodes in a shower of rock and flame. The torrent flows inexorably down the side of Orodruin, and the rocky plain becomes a lake of fire: the Ghâshghurm.\\n\\nThe images become sharper and more distinct, as if the spirit seeks to draw your attention. At last you understand. As the lava pooled at the foot of Orodruin, the iron prison of Naerband became super-heated by its proximity to the lake of fire. Naerband became more than a prison. It became an oven.\\n\\nYou close your eyes to shut out the sight, and at last the spirit relents, its price paid.\\n\\n'Zaghárog,' it says to you: the name of the spirit in the stone.",
