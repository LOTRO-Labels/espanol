Our lands were stolen and reclaimed through the passing of the years, but the Wainriders shaped the line of Kings in a way that no other foe could equal.\\n\\n'After losing his own father to their hordes, King Calimehtar, father of my father, rode against the Wainriders in vengeance. With the help of the North-men, he devastated their ranks, broke their wains and chariots, and slew them upon the hill to the east - a hill which came to be known as Dol Acharn. Such a victory brought peace to Gondor for many years, and Calimehtar never again had to contend with the Wainriders before his death.\\n\\n'Peace, such as it is, is always short-lived. Calimehtar's son and my father, King Ondoher, was forced to meet them in battle. Alas, you are aware of the loss Gondor suffered as a result.\\n\\n'Artamir here has told me much of the days that followed the King's death as well as my own. He tells me that the Wainriders made camp to the south-west, but were ambushed and slain to the last by a vast army under the command of a man named Eärnil. He claims that Eärnil soon became king of Gondor, even in the face of the claim made by my sister's husband, King Arvedui of Arthedain. What tales he has told me of these new days...\\n\\n'Ah, but now the past has risen to confront the present. Fate is a curious thing, [placeholder]... is it not? ",
