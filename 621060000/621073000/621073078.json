Can I count upon you to help me with this aim?'\\n\\nYou assure Elessar that you are with him, and he smiles.\\n\\n'I knew our minds would be alike in this. This, then, is my purpose: I wish to travel my kingdom, from town to town, speaking with the people. I wish to hear what it is they lack, and to provide it; I wish to know how the war has injured them, and do what I can to repair those injuries. I want my people to know that their King is with them, not a distant figure in the Tower of Ecthelion, but a man who knows them and will strive every day of his life to prove he is worthy of Gondor.\\n\\n'I want to tour the kingdom, and see what I can do to heal the hurts of the war.'",

Few perhaps, but some. I am sure they will disappear in time, as did those of the supporters of the Withered Tree, but as of yet they remain.
