The South-guard Ruins, aye, they are full of brigands, and they only get even more dangerous the further north you go!\\n\\n'Who am I? My name is Good-heart. Master Good-heart, to my friends, and I hope you will prove to be one of those. You see, I am only a merchant, and if I am to make my way north to Bree, I would have to pass by those ruffians! Well, in my younger days perhaps I could have done something about those villains, but sadly my sword-swinging days are likely behind me.\\n\\n'But you are an adventurer! No, do not try to deny it: you have the look of one. If you can defeat some of these Greenway raiders, I could see fit to part with some of my coin. I only need you to face the brigands that are here on the road, so no need for you to pass into the South-guard Ruins; it's the villains on the road that are the problem. What do you say?'",
