You present Kurzglok's mandibles to her, and her face contorts into an annoyed revulsion.\\n\\n'I absolutely did not ask for these! But you say the bounty demanded them as proof? Nonsense! One of the other hunters must be playing a prank on me again. They know how much I hate spiders, after all, and if it had been anything else, I'd have dealt with it myself. Well, we'll see who's laughing when I find out who it was!\\n\\n'Nevertheless, I would have taken you at your word, friend. And so long as Kurzglok won't trouble us any longer, that is enough for me. You have my thanks!'",
