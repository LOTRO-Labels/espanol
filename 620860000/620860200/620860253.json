They look like wolves and seem to behave as such, but they are not mortal creatures. They are fell spirits that stalk and hunt Men.\\n\\n'Nor are they aimless -- they are seeking something. The locals say that some were seen in Eregion weeks ago, ranging far and wide in search of their prey, but then they left and returned here to their dens. Only when we of the DÃºnedain came did they emerge and resume their hunt...for us it now seems. They can be slain as any wolf might be, but with death they melt away like a shadow in the light of the noon sun.\\n\\n'When you rescued me I was hunting one of their kind that seemed unique -- a great feral shadow that dominated the others. It was my hope that should this one be slain, then whatever power binds them here would be broken -- but as you know, I became the hunted instead and am still too injured to try my hand at it again. Would you take up my hunt? I cannot say what will come of it, but the passage of our brethren through Enedwaith would be considerably simpler without packs of Shadow-wolves nipping at our flanks the whole way.'",
