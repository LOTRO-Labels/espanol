Listen well, my new friend, and you will hear some of what ails us in Bree-land.

He has a camp on the road west of Bree-town, on the way to Buckland.\\n\\n'Ah, Buckland! That reminds me, don't you know it, there is trouble afoot there as well. You know that Bree-town is home to both hobbits and Men, of course. Well, Buckland is home to hobbits only, but I would count them as neighbours as well, of course! It seems they have had some trouble with goings-on in the Old Forest. If you speak with Celandine Brandybuck, a sweet young lass who lives away in Buckland, you are certain to hear about that forest trouble. Everyone has their hands full, whether they be tall or small!\\n\\n'Oh, did I ask you to speak with old Grimbriar yet? There is hustle and bustle a-plenty, and one thing drives out another, even if you are uncommonly sharp, like yours truly. Grimbriar is the Chief Watcher, and he maintains a post on the road north of Bree-town. I understand he has had some trouble with brigands of late. Go see him and help him with the outlaws, and you'd be doing Bree-land a service!\\n\\n'That should be enough for starters, my friend! Now, if you'll excuse me, I should see to the needs of the host.
