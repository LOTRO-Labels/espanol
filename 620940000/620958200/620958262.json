I do not ask you to accompany me on the ships. Instead, I ask you to travel by land through Upper Lebennin and Lossarnach. We must learn the state of the war to the east. The vale of Tumladen and the town of Imloth Melui had strong walls of old, and were used as places of safety for the people in times of war. The people there will tell you much of what has transpired elsewhere in Gondor. Angbor will go that way as well, with his men, and will be a boon companion as you go.\\n\\n'I have another purpose for you, my trusted friend. I want you to find Gandalf or true-hearted Faramir in Minas Tirith and tell them about our victory here. Tell no others! In Faramir I place the trust I would not give to the father.
