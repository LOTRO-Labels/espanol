The night was dark and the shadows were deep, and my blood ran cold at every creepy sound! I knew if I did not do something, Celandine would know me for a coward. Cry disaster! In order to mask my fear, I adopted a brazen attitude and mocked every fear I felt. It was all an act, an act at which I have become all too practiced!'\\n\\nDinodas frowns.\\n\\n'Still, Bingo is my cousin, and that was a mean trick for any family member to perform, at any remove and no matter the distance! Speaking of distance, I was on my way back to the Greenfields when you caught up to me. I turned around because I heard something scary and dropped my pack, and ran back this way.
