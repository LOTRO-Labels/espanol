Others, including some of the dwarves who work for me, turned to games to pass the time. Have you heard of this ridiculous Stacking Game they invented?\\n\\n'Ah, I understand it, even as I think it is needlessly frivolous in such times as we live in. I allow them to pass the time as they see fit... so long as they quickly respond when I have a task for them! And this is the case today.
