They may summon a Herald companion to fight by their side, ensuring they always have an ally to buff. They can also Mark foes, giving benefits to all who attack them. In fellowships, a Captain supports his allies with healing and buffs, while still dealing respectable damage.</li>\\n\\n<li><rgb=#FFFF00>Lore:</rgb> The Captains of Middle-earth hold the future in their hands.
