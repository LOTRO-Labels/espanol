Yes I've heard a little bit about you - I understand that you've been busy unearthing the riddles of the Lone-lands recently.\\n\\nI wish you luck, for what good it'll do us all. I've heard many a rumour of late - all sorts of evils seem to be creeping up out of the ground to assail the West, and only a rare few such as yourself to hold them back. It doesn't seem fair does it?\\n\\nI suppose that is the way of things, like it or not. Well at least I might be able to - as they say - go out with a song, hmm? So tell me your tales and I'll see if I can come up with a suitible final ballad for them.'",
