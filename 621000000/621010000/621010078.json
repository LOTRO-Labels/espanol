He and his brood approach the mountain even now, and I have sent as many warriors as I can spare to guard the gates of Erebor. Many of the Dale-folk have sought refuge within Erebor, and the Elvenking has sent a company of his finest archers to aid us. Thikil-gundu still bears the cold scars of his ire for Durin's Folk, but I will fight to my last breath to ensure Erebor does not come to such an end. All have made ready for the coming of Vethúg, and this time, he will not take us by surprise. We of Durin's Folk will strike him down!\\n\\n'When you are prepared, we shall join with my warriors before the gates of Erebor.'",
