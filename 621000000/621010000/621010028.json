It seems to me that Ivy and Halson lived during the time of the Long Winter, which gripped the Shire more than two hundred and fifty years ago! That winter was the longest ever recorded, and it was followed by the Days of Dearth, a period of famine and unhappiness the like of which has never been seen again. It is said that many hobbits died during that winter and the food shortage that followed. I hope that fate did not befall Ivy or Halson, but if there are no further letters it seems likely they came to sad ends.\\n\\n'I wonder why these letters were never delivered? The hobbits of the Quick Post must have had their hands full just trying to survive the Long Winter, but still I would have expected them to make an effort, at least before it became clear the winter was worse than usual. It does strike me as somewhat odd that the letters that pre-date the snows were not delivered.'",
