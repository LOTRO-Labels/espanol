Within, there lies a vast store of lumber which we could readily use to begin repairs across Khazad-dûm.\\n\\n'Unfortunately, we cannot claim this store-house until the intruders within have been dealt with. Perhaps with your aid, we could strike terror into these intruders and drive them out.\\n\\n'I am certain that these intruders have a leader, someone -- or something -- that holds sway over them. Quickly, enter Bult-kâr and dispatch the foe who commands the rest of those within.'\\n\\n<rgb=#FF0000>The Iron Garrison has created a diversion, drawing the bulk of the intruders from the depths of Bult-kâr. They are permitting you access for one hour, during which time you may enter and exit Bult-kâr freely to complete the tasks bestown upon you.\\n\\nHowever, after the hour has passed, the Iron Garrison can no longer guarantee your safety and thus will bar access until they can once again muster an offence to draw the enemy from Bult-kâr.</rgb>",
