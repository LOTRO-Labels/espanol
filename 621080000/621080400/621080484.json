Did he survive the wreck of his ship during my pursuit, and come to make a desperate living upon the wild Shield Isles? He did not hold hatred for Gondor in his heart before that night, whatever the Steward may have believed, but afterwards...? No man could do otherwise.\\n\\n'I cannot know by what paths he returned to Umbar, but when he did it seems he found others who shared his mind. Did he rise through the ranks of the Kindred, or perhaps he was there at its founding? Now, at least, he holds a position with enough standing to warrant one of Saklaphêl's bounties!'\\n\\nSirgon stares at you unhappily.\\n\\n'I was so pleased to sail again, [placeholder]. I had consigned these feelings of guilt to the past, and let the passing of the years dull their pain. But if Belondor did not drown on that night, if he now leads the Kindred of the Coins that hold Thorongil and your Elf-friend captive... I fear that the history between us may put both of those lives in greater danger than we believed. And all because I thought I missed the Sea... but I earned my own share of guilt upon the waters, [placeholder]. I had thought it gone, but it is never truly gone, is it?'\\n\\nYou tell Sirgon that it is the mission of the Wave-hunter to rescue Nauriel's son Thorongil and your friend Corudan from the Kindred of the Coins, no matter who comprises its membership. He nods, reluctantly.\\n\\n'Aye. It must be so. But you must tell the Lady Nauriel what I have told you. If her son may be further endangered by this account, she deserves to know of it.'",

She raises an eyebrow at you and puts her hand on the hilt of her sword, toying with the favour tied there by her husband Carandolion.\\n\\n'It matters not to me, [placeholder], unless Sirgon thinks to stand with the Kindred of the Coins against us when the time comes to rescue my son. Do you think he might?\\n\\n'But that is still some time away; we must first leave these islands and reach the City of the Corsairs. Daxamat and some others of the crew have gone to the settlement of Halrax on the southern island of Zamarzîr to see what they can learn of the bounty-hunters Saklaphêl has likely employed.

There are not many folk who remember me, but there are a few. I learned from them that perhaps a dozen bounty-hunters met with Saklaphêl's man Galadaith, but of that number only three seemed serious about it. One of these I heard talk about even when I was just a child: the Blade-twist, who must be an old man by now, surely. The other is a woman, Cruel Dancer, and of those I spoke to she is believed to have the greatest chance of actually claiming any of the bounties.\\n\\n'It seems the Blade-twist and Cruel Dancer have already departed the islands, but the third bounty-hunter may still be here.
