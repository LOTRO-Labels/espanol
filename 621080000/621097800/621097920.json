We would make funny animals: ducks, and rabbits, and chickens. Oh, and the stories we would tell! The adventures those rabbits and ducks had! Such stories. My sisters have since passed, taken each by disease or famine or war. Sometimes I still see those shadows though; dancing, laughing, playing. I can still hear their laughter.\\n\\n'When my husband would come home, I would first see him by the shadow he cast on the wall by our home. So broad and powerful, that shadow was the harbinger of my precious Eshtali coming home to me. Just like my sisters, I sought comfort in that shadow, always steady, strangely solid.\\n\\n'After he was taken, I am ashamed to say I forgot what his face looked like, once so familiar to me. All I can see now of him is that shadow on the wall, insubstantial like a wraith, endlessly dancing through my memories.'",
