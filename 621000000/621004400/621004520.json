Still, if the others can provide me with tasks to dole out to willing adventurers, there's no reason for a Gamgee to be exempted!\\n\\n'Eventually he relented, and provided me with a request. It is a simple one and quite straightforward, although the execution of it will be anything but, if the rumours I have heard are true! Samwise asks that adventurers defeat spiders in Lhingris, where there is no shortage of the things. He is quite upset about the spiders, for some reason, but he would not tell me why. At any rate, it will be a helpful errand. Fulfill this request and I will have a reward for you! Samwise's own reward is that I will not bother him for another request for some days!'",
