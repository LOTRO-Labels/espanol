That is simply the sweetest thing anyone has ever done. Between the two of us, I must admit that I've been watching him as well, hoping that he would say something. If it doesn't sound too forward, I was hoping he would get past his shyness to speak with me. In fact, I even sent him some sweets I made. Since he didn't mention them to you, I can only assume that I must have delivered them to the wrong address as well. \\n\\n'If I could ask for a small favour, could you please collect the sweets for me and deliver them to poor Avery? I certainly hope he enjoys them.'",
