He pulls a long, black arrow from the quiver and its tip drips with some vile poison. After a moment, he carefully lowers the arrow back into the quiver.\\n\\n'If this is the quiver of the Orc I suspect, you have done the Dúnedain a great service this day. I cannot say for certain, but I believe he was of the Tarkrîp clan. They delight in the slaying of Men and have troubled my kin and I every time our paths have crossed.\\n\\n'To my mind, there is little that strikes fear into the hearts of Orcs, but perhaps this quiver will help us to ward them away from our encampments. Thank you, friend!'",
