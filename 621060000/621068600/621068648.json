Visual evidence suggests that there are spiders collecting poor unsuspecting travellers or would-be adventurers wandering too close to their nests within the dark wood. The reports of the missing vary from Men to hobbits and some scouts have reported hearing that brigands and half-orcs have gone missing too. If you are willing, we will reward you for looking into the goings on in the Old Forest.'",
