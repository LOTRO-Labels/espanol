Do you remember the fell mood that seized him in Angmar, before the Grey Company was assembled? I thought he had left it behind him. Indeed, it seemed that the journey was doing him some good, but it returned again in TÃ»r Morva, only to be overcome by the gentle laughter of the Dunlending girl, Wenda.\\n\\n'But like the rising and falling brimstone pools of Malenhad, his ill mood has returned after a short time at low ebb, and now he shouts at his own dear friends! If you seek him out, know that I left him standing on a dock to the south, looking out at the water. I will not be held responsible if he treats you unkindly, for it seems he does not know his friends.'",
