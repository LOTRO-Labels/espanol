Many folk till the fields of Lamedon, and work the fertile ground through which flow the Five Streams, further to the east in Lebennin. The land of Anórien lies beyond the White Mountains, and at their eastern foot stands Minas Tirith, greatest city of Gondor and Tower of Guard, from which the dark lands to the east are watched.\\n\\n'Prince Imrahil has gone there with many hundreds of his finest warriors, for war is certain to be joined in the coming weeks.\\n\\n'If that is so, war will come first to Ithilien, the lands beyond the River Anduin, on the very border of the Black Land.'",
