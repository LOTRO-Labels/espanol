The roots from Fangorn, the sun from the Riddermark, the water from the Highknoll all combine to create a unique environment for creatures to prosper. One of them is a strange little frog. While they are poisonous to eat, if the slime covering the frog's body is placed within an arrow wound, the wound will not fester and instead will close and heal rapidly. A rather curious thing in my mind.'",
