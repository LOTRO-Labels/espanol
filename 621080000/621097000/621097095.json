Embraced in all southern lands and is taking hold in Ambarûl. Now is the Time of Pyres, when Barkhûshim have gained such power that the people turn openly on those who still practice the rites of Írmu Who Weeps within much of Hamât. They ransack the temples and burn the Faithful. The people lose faith in the Weeping Lady and erect shrines to the All-seeing.\\n\\nWe are being driven underground and must hide ourselves and our relics lest the Church find us.'",
