      "en": "Your War-steed handles differently than your regular mount.\\n\\nHold the Forward/Back keys (default: W/S) to increase or decrease your War-steed's speed, and it can take a short time to reach full speed. You can reduce your War-steed's speed to a full stop quickly by double tapping the Back key.\\n\\nTurning is executed using the Left/Right keys (default : A/D), or by holding your Right Mouse Button and looking in the direction you wish to turn.\\n\\nYour steed's ability to turn is limited by how fast you are moving. Up to a trot (about 1/2 speed) your steed will retain its full turning ability -- above trot, and particularly at a full gallop, you will find your ability to turn to be substantially reduced.\\n\\nTip: Some people -- particularly those who control their avatar exclusively with the mouse -- find it easier to control their mount if it is set to automatically slow down when they are not pushing to move. The 'War-steed Auto-slowdown' option can be found in the Combat Options panel.",
