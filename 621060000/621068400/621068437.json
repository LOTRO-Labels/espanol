It appears that the brigands inhabiting the ruins of Gaervarad are not the most sanitary lot. Worse still, the provisions they have stolen from farmsteads and trappers in the region waste away in makeshift storage not suitable for... well... swine.\\n\\n'Now, I know that this seems a meager task, but the foodstuff there is wont to spread disease if it is not destroyed. If you are willing to undertake the effort, we are willing to reward you for entering those ruins and destroying a good number of their food stores.\\n\\n'What's more, you'll surely encounter a few of those ruffians when you are there, and thinning their number will only bolster the surrounding area.
