Mere traps could not stop the Host of the West, but I fear that they may soon devise a greater scheme to hinder our allies. The pass provides swift passage to the north, but it is narrow and any that pass through it must fear an ambush.\\n\\n'I would ask that you scout Cirith Negen and destroy any traps you find. If the Khundolar are still trapping the pass, you must defeat them as well. Nothing can be left to chance, my friend, especially now that the Enemy has suffered his greatest defeat in recent memory.\\n\\n'When that is done, seek Tordoron and aid him as you may. He has scouted the pass of Cirith Negen and now searches the northern reaches of Ithilien for the Enemy's encampment.'",
