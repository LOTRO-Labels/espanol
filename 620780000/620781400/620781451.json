Even the rare springs of pure water can sometimes turn foul, when some old poison leeches from the soil.\\n\\n'Of course, we must know which water is pure and which foul, but it is a deadly game to tell merely by taste. Instead we collect water from various springs and feed it to swamp-fly grubs. These creatures will sicken and die if they are given foul water.\\n\\n'Banners have been placed at six of the shallow springs of the swamp where once fresh water could be found. Take these water-skins, find the banners, and collect water from the six springs, so that we may learn if the springs still run true.'",
