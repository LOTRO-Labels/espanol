The text is so ancient that some of the pages threaten to crumble in your hands as you carefully peruse it. While the dialect is ancient and difficult to read, the author's approach to swordsmanship is rather unusual, placing a great deal of emphasis on grueling repetition and concentration around what appear to be the most basic motions of the form. It suggests a focus on absolute control and power, which then leads to the discovery of finesse and artistry.\\n\\nIf only several key passages and pages were not missing, it could be an invaluable training guide -- perhaps Gimli the Dwarf could tell you more?",
