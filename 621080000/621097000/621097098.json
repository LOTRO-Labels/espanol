In Haradwaith, the war goes well, though it was not always so. From Harondor we crossed the river and defeated the Haradrim at the Battle of the Carrion Dam. Their army was disorganized and it turned into a great victory. Many foes were slain. We then took the lands north of the Reed-flood at great cost, but could not cross to the south because the enemy destroyed the only bridge.\\n\\nThis bought them time to rally their troops for a counter-attack that forced us north again. The prince was wounded in battle with a fell blade of some evil make. An injury it gave him, that could not be healed by any art. The prince faded and succumbed to his wound, as you likely have already learned. We were unnerved but we pushed south again, driven by the king's wrath.\\n\\nAided by victories on the coast, our second march south proved more successful. I believe the Haradrim kings are dead already, and Harad will soon kneel before Gondor and swear fealty to the king, as they will have no other choice. I hear that we will not be returning immediately upon their surrender, so do not expect it. I believe we will first be demanding tithe and tribute from those we have conquered.\\n\\nSend my love to Beardsley and do give him some rubs upon the belly on my behalf.\\n\\nYour loving brother,\\n Amathion'",
