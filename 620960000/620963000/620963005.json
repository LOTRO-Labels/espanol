There is particular, tasty, white mushroom that usually only grows in the caves of Mount Mindolluin. Now they grow in the cisterns! I suspect the cave-lizards may have helped spread the mushrooms from the caves high above us to the cisterns. Perhaps they have done us some good after all! This mushroom has been growing so well in the cisterns that I believe we can start harvesting it. Would you be kind enough while you're in the tunnels to pick some?'",
