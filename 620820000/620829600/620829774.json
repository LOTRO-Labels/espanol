One of the greatest secrets of these depths is the libraries they contain, and one of them is more of a secret than any other.\\n\\n'We are calling this place Mezel-katub. Records we recovered indicate that Balin gathered together vast amounts of long forgotten knowledge and placed it here. If we were to recover even one of the tomes from inside, I cannot imagine the secrets and wonders we could relearn. But Mezel-katub does not reveal itself to any who pass by. No, it must be found to be entered.\\n\\n'I can tell you where to begin your search, but that is all, unfortunately. Search to the south, near the Orc-camps of Skrithûrz-ulíma and Baiúrz-mur for the entrance to Mezel-katub. You will know it when you find it, as long as you have that yellow lamp.'",
