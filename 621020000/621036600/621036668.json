We went deep into the mountain, into places that I have never been before. That familiar smell hit me long before we reached the cavern from which the crystals are harvested. Will it ever not make me gag? I dream of that filthy stink. It is nearly worse than the piles of refuse the hobgoblins leave rotting in their camps.",
