Many months and more miles have passed since I saw you last at Helm's Deep, in Rohan!'\\n\\nYou tell Corudan, briefly, about some of the experiences you have had since his departure. He asks if you know how Leafshade fared after he went away, and you say as far as you know the Ent remains in good health and spirits. He smiles fondly.\\n\\n'I am glad. I do not doubt that he could have survived any attack by Nakási or Tatháta if he was roused to battle, but I feared for the creatures of his grove and the trees for which he cared. I know the Ents are fearsome when enraged... but I cannot help but think something is lost when they are called to fight. Something in them is wounded. It is true for Men and Elves, in my experience, and I think it may be so for the Ents as well. They are meant for peace, for the care and tending of things that grow.\\n\\n'I went with the Corsairs so they would not force Leafshade into battle. I sought to exert my influence upon them, and while I was not wholly successful I think it was for the best. Save for my words I fear the boy Thorongil would not have lived to reach Umbar.'",
