Arvedui?'\\n\\nYou nod, and deliver his message of good tidings. Elessar smiles and bows deeply before his predecessor. Arvedui nods solemnly, his spectral eyes filled with tears of joy, and vanishes completely.\\n\\n'He is gone. You did find a way to ease his spirit!'\\n\\nYou tell Elessar that the final thing he needed to pass on was a new king on the throne.\\n\\n'Have you known this since your time in Forochel? And he had you promise not to tell me, to spare me the additional pressure? Of course.'\\n\\nHe chuckles and shakes his head.\\n\\n'[placeholder], thank you for your part in putting my ancestor's spirit to rest. My heart swells with pride knowing that he was here to witness my coronation. I only hope I am able to rule with wisdom and a just heart, as Arvedui and those who came before him did.'",
