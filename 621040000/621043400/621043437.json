We also believe that their leader, Warlord Dushtalbúk, and his advisors are currently here, holed up in their fort to avoid the growing unrest between the enemy forces.\\n\\n'Our mission here is to locate their fort, discover the scope of their power, and if we are very fortunate indeed, slay the warlord himself. The timing is vital. If we can remove Dushtalbúk from the table before the hobgoblins and Orcs reconcile their differences, they may be unable to organize again before we deal a decisive blow and win this war. \\n\\n'Because of this mission's importance, Prince Durin has personally asked me to oversee it. You, [placeholder], will also be instrumental in our success. I have not come alone, however. I have taken on three apprentices that I would like you to meet. I have been teaching them the ways of stealth and of the dagger. Go, introduce yourself. I expect they will be excited to meet you, for they have heard tell of your exploits!'",
