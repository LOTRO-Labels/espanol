Eärendur son of Elendur was the last King of Arnor, before his sons splintered the North Kingdom into the realms of Arthedain, Cardolan, and Rhudaur. Unfortunately, much lore of those final days was lost with him.\\n\\n'He rests still in his tomb, Haudh Eärendur, and with him, we believe, some fragments of the knowledge of the last days of Arnor. Would you perhaps venture into the tomb and take rubbings of any engravings you might find there?\\n\\n'Be wary, for I do not doubt that enemies, beasts, or the elements have invaded that tomb, as they have so many others here.'",
