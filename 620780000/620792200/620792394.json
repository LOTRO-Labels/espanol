We must go on the offensive, if we can, and to do that, we need information.\\n\\n'Several positions throughout the city have changed hands numerous times in recent days, and it is my belief that these sites are of particular significance to Amarthiel. We fight to reclaim them whenever possible, but ownership of these sites is as fluid as the shoreline of Lake Nenuial: always in motion.\\n\\n'I would ask you to journey to these volatile areas and defeat the minions of Amarthiel there, for some of them are sure to carry orders containing the future plans of her armies. If the Dúnedain hold the site, look for corpses of enemies killed in the fighting and search them for such orders. We need orders from these three locations, [placeholder]: from the courtyard of Gwaelband, to the north-east, where you encountered Rosselloth; from Clorhir, in front of the pools of Glinghant, east of Echad Garthadir; and at Menelband, on the highest level of the city.'",
