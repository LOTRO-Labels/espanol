I, myself, might have turned my head away and spoken no words to you on the weary, dusty roads that lie behind. Yet the moment I set my eyes upon these grand peaks, these open spaces, something in my heart opened, too.\\n\\n'No, friend, I will be truly honest with you. We are in need of way-food. We cannot tarry to cook, for we must keep moving and join  with our národ, up ahead. We have stumbled upon some nuts and berries already, but could use more. \\n\\n'Would you, who are well-rested and full of vigour, gather some as you go, and meet me at Dôm Goru, a small camp up the road?'",
