They could use your help catching fish to be salted and smoked for the winter.\\n\\n'Look for Undeg. She is coordinating our tradesfolk and can help you take up a crafting profession such as weaponsmithing or cooking. Head north-west along the path by the water. She'll be with other crafters and the community oven.\\n\\n'Eluna here is training many of our new scouts, and as much as she may deny it, she could use a helping hand, as we all do from time to time.'",
