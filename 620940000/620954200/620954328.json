Grimbeorn sent me to Eriador to track a man that has turned to evil. He has already slain many innocent folk, and believes himself to be above the laws of Men. It is Grimbeorn's command that I track this man and put an end to his evil ways.\\n\\nI do not know how to tell you this, but I must. This man of which I write is Ofolmóth. He is of Beorn's line, and he is family, but he has become a menace to all he encounters. It is my duty to end him.\\n\\nI will make for Ost Guruth, the ruin-hold in the Lone-lands where he was last seen. Find me there, my dear one. I will need your help in this!\\n\\nLanghár, in sorrow",
