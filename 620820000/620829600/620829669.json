The deep-toads are the key to the survival of the lizards and spiders. To strike the deep-toads will be to strike their predators as well.\\n\\n'How, you ask? The lizards are unaffected by the venom of the spiders, and so the spiders cannot weaken them, making them undesirable prey for the spiders. Also, the lizards have enough cunning to avoid the webs of the spiders. The toads, on the other hand, are nearly mindless in contrast; lizard and spider alike have little difficulty trapping and devouring the toads.\\n\\n'If you remove the toads, the spiders and lizards will have no choice but to fall upon each other. Will you do this?'",
