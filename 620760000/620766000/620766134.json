This alliance is one of ill omen, if alliance it be, and I am concerned not only for the House of Elrond but also for our dwarf friends, who have established a camp not far to the north.\\n\\n'If by some fortune you are able to defeat some of the mammoths, bring me their tusk-rings for further study.
