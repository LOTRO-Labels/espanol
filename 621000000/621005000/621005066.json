By His command, I devised pains and torments unequalled in any of the Ages of the world.\\n\\nBefore the Mountain raged, I was the master of all that transpired within the iron walls of the Direhold. I was the greatest of the Dark Lord's torturers. But on the day the Mountain was rent asunder and its fires cascaded, when the iron walls of Naerband became not just a prison, but an oven. When the screams of the roasting doomed filled the air, I beheld that savage masterwork and knew that Sauron, even in death and ruin, was truly the master.\\n\\nI have much to learn if I am to become Shakh Thrakn没l, and surpass the Dark Lord in the arts of pain. I need some new captives.",
