That makes things more difficult to be sure. Only that road can support the movement of my four thousand men. We simply do not have the time or the resources to ferry that many warriors across the Anduin, and moving them through the forests of Ithilien in a wide sweep would be far too slow and take too much time. If we take such a course, the war will be ended before my men get there! No, they must retake the Harlond, and they will need me to lead them in this effort.\\n\\n'You, however, have another errand. Aragorn wanted you to reach either Gandalf or Faramir? You can take a single craft across the Anduin and move more swiftly than four thousand. You must pass into Ithilien and come by that way to Osgiliath. Meanwhile, my men will assail the Harlond.\\n\\n'My scouts learned that a friend to Gondor operates a secret ferry to the east, among the high reeds that border the river.
