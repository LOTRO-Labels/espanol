All the while, our resources dwindle, while the Enemy continues to garner strength.\\n\\n'We are in dire need of replenishing our supplies for the effort, and that is why I need your help. To the north there is a mine, where our dwarf-allies delve when the Snowreap-goblins are not within the caverns. There are stores there, of unrefined ore. We can refine the ore and build axes, swords, and hammers...but first we need the ore.\\n\\n'Ore alone, however, will not solidify the war effort. There are thicker logs, some already hewn to the ground, scattered throughout the Grimwood and others still may be obtained from the deadly, walking Leafcull-trees. If you mean to aid us, gather logs and ore for me and bring them back so I may continue to fuel our efforts.'",
