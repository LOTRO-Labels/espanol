It seems that the eyes of Dol Guldur are not watching the Scuttledells, but that will be no relief to any of our company who fall to the spiders in the name of secrecy!\\n\\n'Take this cloth, and use it to gather the venom from slain spiders here in the Scuttledells; I will see how perilous it may be.'",
