Moving an outfit to the Wardrobe will preserve the original in your pack while copying its appearance to your Wardrobe. Outfits in your Wardrobe can be dyed without needing the original item and every colour is preserved allowing you to store all colours on any given item. If the original item is dyed and previously stored in Wardrobe as another colour, then moving the item back into the Wardrobe will add the new colour. Since outfits in your Wardrobe are copies they can only be permanently removed and never restored to your pack. Restricted and bound outfits can be copied to your Wardrobe and used by your other characters as long as the restricted outfit can be worn by the character copying it to Wardrobe.",
