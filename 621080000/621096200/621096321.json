He was scouting Kûr Anzar, and I fear the Barkhûshim, those twisted adherents to the Church of the All-seeing, may have captured him.\\n\\n'You seem like you can handle yourself, perhaps better than some warriors I might send. Please, find Razâl for me. He was sent to the eastern outskirts of Kûr Anzar, to map the movements of the Barkhûshim. If he has been captured, it is likely there you may find him, or some clue to his whereabouts. We need every soldier we have, particularly one with Razâl's talent for burgling. Please, if you find him, order him to report back to me immediately. He is one of my best warriors, but he takes such foolish risks sometimes.'",

After two hours of watching, I felt a group of eyes watching me. I whirled around, but I was too late. They easily overpowered me and tied me up here. They left to report their success to their leader, Okhíso. It's quite fortuitous that you arrived when you did.\\n\\n'Mizâdi wants me to report back? I will return to her at once. You have done so much for me, but if I may ask you for another favour... there were three locations left on my list that I was intending to survey before I was... interrupted. Could you scout them for me? There are three outlooks along the ridge north of here where you can clearly see into Kûr Anzar. Look at each location and catalogue the number of All-seeing you see. It would be invaluable for the war effort. Thank you for all you have done for me. I am certain our paths will cross again soon.'",
