It came from elsewhere, and the corruption that envelops it stems from its long stay in the Black Land. If this evil could be cleansed, I believe that Elrond could imbue it with a powerful and vital force for Good.\\n\\n'Before that can happen, however, we must do something about the corruption that Mordor has worked upon it. There are different methods to accomplish this, though the Wise disagree upon the effectiveness of each. My preferred means for such a cure is to bring the corrupted item to the place where it was made, or to places of some significance upon its path, and to thereby diffuse the foul touch of Mordor that has, in the interim, claimed it. We must learn the story of this heirloom before it came to Mordor.'\\n\\nThe Wizard turns the artifact over in his hands, studying it for some clue to its origin. To your eye the heirloom is a small brooch made of bone, encircled by what appears to be a curved piece of antler. It reminds you of the Lossoth of Forochel. Mithrandir seems to pick up on your assessment.\\n\\n'Yes, [placeholder], this brooch was clearly fashioned by Lossoth hands. In material and in style this brooch of bone began its journey near the Ice-bay. That is where you should bring it, for reminding it of its origin may help to cleanse the corruption that enveloped it within Mordor.\\n\\n'Go to the city of Sûri-kylä, and find Lothrandir of the Dúnedain.
