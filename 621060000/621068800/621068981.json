Sometimes they move through the grass and rustle the branches of the bare trees, and then you know they are there. Other times they house themselves in the body of a corpse, and become the animate Dead. Whichever form they take, they are dangerous, and must be ended by those of us brave enough, or foolish enough, to take the chance. If you are either of these two... I wish you luck.'",
