This indicates the type of facility that you are near. The appearance of that icon will become familiar in time but, you can always place your mouse pointer over the icon to receive more information about the particular facility that you are near.\\n\\nAs a Jeweller, you will need to be near a <rgb=#FF00FF00>workbench</rgb> to execute many of your recipes.\\n\\n<rgb=#FF00FF00>Note: You can double-click on any facility to open your craft panel.</rgb>",
