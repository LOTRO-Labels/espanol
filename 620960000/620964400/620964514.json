My husband has gone to war and Círgon will not say it, but I know it tears at him. He has spent much time alone over the past few weeks, and does not even speak to his friends. He spends every morning down at the Baths sailing the ships he and Círhir built together. That, or he wanders Egalmoth's Green and sits alone in the dark of the trees.\\n\\n'Is this how a child should cope? It does not seem so to me, and I worry for him. We all feel the loss of our loved ones and he must understand that we are together in our sorrows.\\n\\n'Please, go find him, and tell him to return to me. I have prepared supper and I cannot allow Círgon to sacrifice another meal to his sadness.'",
