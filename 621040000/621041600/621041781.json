Into that hateful frenzy, a great mass of crows descended, and to them, the Orcs began to fling the scraps of the Dwarf-king. Nár dared not look again.\\n\\n'Tear-blind, Nár ran on along the banks of Kheled-zâram, fleeing the Orcs and wolves that now hunted him in cruel sport. When at last he came to the ruins of Amdân, he found them barred, and black arrows hounded his every step. Desperate to escape his own doom, however, Nár thought of Kibil-nâla and leapt down the paths alongside the stream. By some stroke of fortune, Nár had won his escape, but behind him the laughter of Azog and the Orcs rang in his ears.\\n\\n'For many months, Nár wandered in the wilderness, wracked with sorrow, the sight of his King’s defilement branded in his heart. At long last, he found his way north to the High Pass across the Misty Mountains, then made his way back to Thrór’s Coomb. By the time he entered Zudrugund the guards scarcely recognized him, so haggard and wild he had grown.\\n\\n'Nár was never well in his mind again.'",
