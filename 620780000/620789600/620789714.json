Many roads have I travelled since that day, and many evils fought, but the path now beneath my feet and the foes arrayed before me are more dangerous than ever I have faced. The time has come for strength; the light of Narsil must be rekindled.\\n\\nYou know of what I speak, Calenglad -- the Silithar must be recovered. I am ready to take up the burden that has been set before me, but Gwindeth must give me her approval or that readiness will mean nothing.\\n\\nThe bearer of this letter acts as my agent and speaks with my voice. Verify the authenticity of its carrier in the common way of the Dúnedain. Evendim and Nenuial are in my thoughts, Calenglad. I hope that you are well.\\n\\nAragorn son of Arathorn, Lord of the Dúnedain",
