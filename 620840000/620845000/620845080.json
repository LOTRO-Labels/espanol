Alas that we have not the resources for such a great undertaking. Even the smallest good deeds must often go undone, for our eyes are fixed upon one target only.\\n\\n'Dannenglor was once an Elven-home and is overrun now by shrieking beasts of all kinds. The merrevail and mervyl are violations of nature, and even the bats of this forest are unwholesome and evil.\\n\\n'If you wish to make Mirkwood a little better on behalf of the Galadhrim who must pass through it, you should cleanse those ruins of the vile swarms of bats that give strength to the presence of the merrevail. Will you do this for us? Dannenglor will never be fair again, but you can perhaps begin to cast the evil from within its walls.'",
