      "en": "I think if you were to sail for Umbar with only one other, it would have to be the Lady Nauriel! There is no way you can keep her from joining the crew of the Wave-hunter, and should you try I believe she will swim behind the boat and deal you grievous injuries with her blade when she catches up!\\n\\nShe is a Knight of the Green Hills, so she will be no burden on the voyage, but she is also the mother of Thorongil. That by itself will fill her with such fury that she will prove a deadly member of the crew. If anything, you may need to restrain her from doing violence upon the Kindred of the Coins at an inopportune moment, lest you risk further incident between Gondor and Umbar.\\n\\nLady Nauriel can be found within the hall of Ost Arnd√≠r, in Pinnath Gelin. Her husband Carandolion is of very different temperament, and I suspect he will not be interested in joining the crew, but perhaps you can ask him.",
