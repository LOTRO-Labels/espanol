I believe I have unravelled the clues you discovered.\\n\\n'I have come to believe that the tales which speak of Enârshan and the Falls of Ilûritu, are meant to be read directly.\\n\\n'My group and I have searched these falls and the surrounding hills for any dwellings or places where the Idâmi may be. But we have not done what the stories say... exactly.\\n\\n'The stories all say that the Idâmi dwells within the waterfall. Mayhap by within they are saying that there is a dwelling behind the falls themselves? Your discoveries appear to point to this as well, and we had not chanced to venture there as it was too dangerous to climb behind the falls.\\n\\n'I ask that you go and search for yourself. It should not be a problem for a hardy adventurer such as you! I believe that you will find Enârshan there. But I beg you to be careful if you do.'",
