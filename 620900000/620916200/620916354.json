That weald has come to be known as Balewood and is a haven for none, especially those left defenceless after NÃºrzum ravaged our lands. I only hope they travelled elsewhere as they fled, for settling in such a place would not bode well.\\n'To the south-west of here, near the southern border of Balewood in Whitshaws, there may still remain a small camp of Rohirrim who kept watch on the Orcs passing into our lands.
