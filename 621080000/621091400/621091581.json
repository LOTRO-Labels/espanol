It is not so for all who walk these tunnels.\\n\\n'I speak of the unseen ones, those the Umbari call \\qMâtrikhai.\\q My people have another name for them; to us they are the \\qTerâsi,\\q the forgotten ones. They creep into places no others could, and move with such speed that should you catch a glimpse of them from the corner of your eye, by the time you turned to look they have gone. They are children of Umbar, I think, and move about Umbar-môkh by secret passageways unknown to any other. It is said the Terâsi prowl the markets of the Upper Ward and the Lower when they are most crowded, stealing goods and coin whenever they can, and then slipping back into the tunnels and caverns undetected.\\n\\n'Temámir hearts warm to the Terâsi, for we see their hardships and take pity upon them. It has been our custom to leave food for these forgotten ones throughout Umbar-môkh on occasion. I will give you this crusty bread so you can do this as well. There is a suitable metal plate where you can leave it in the far south-eastern corner of Ilmabiri, but you should clear the area of crocodiles and rats before you do. If one of the Terâsi claims our gift, you should ask them if they know where your missing Kinswoman has gone.'",
