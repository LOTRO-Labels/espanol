The Men of Cardolan took many of those who fell sick to the Plague there. The ruins of that fortress still stand today in the south! It is from here that a terror rose and cursed the brothers for their theft.\\n\\n'If you are willing, you may seek the treasure or the history of that treasure at the Northern Barrow, not far from here to the east.
