But I knew it was not so. I knew in my bones that Karazgar still lived, but none of the scouts have seen any sign of him since the expedition returned.\\n\\n'We know he is a master of stealth. Did he not prove his ability to move silently when he first ambushed me, cutting my leg with his cruel blade and robbing me of my fleetness? If he does not wish to be found, even the most alert of our scouts will not find him.\\n\\n'I stood nearby and listened as Hórin gave his report to Inek, who succeeded Bótuz Frostblood as the leader of my people here at Skarháld, and I think they missed something important! Karazgar had control over much of the Frost-horde, yes; did he not use its drakes and worms to attack us here? But that power derived from his mastery over Vethúg Wintermind. According to Hórin's account, Karazgar began to lose control over Vethúg as the battle turned against him, and when Vethúg perished, the drake died cursing his former master. What if Karazgar's control over the Frost-horde perished with Vethúg, [placeholder]?\\n\\n'Instead of scouting from on high for Karazgar, I instead watched for strange behaviour on the part of frost-drakes in the mountains. And behold! I saw many of the creatures moving with single-minded purpose. Not on behalf of Karazgar, no. I think they are seeking for him, wounded as he is, for the same purpose as I. I think the drakes seek him for vengeance, [placeholder]. If we follow their tracks, they may lead us right to Karazgar!\\n\\n'I saw them south of here!
