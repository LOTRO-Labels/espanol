But then he tells me...oil, great gobs of boiling oil.\\n\\n'We're going to need this oil, and we can only get it from the Free Peoples...the very ones we're trying to boil! We know there is a camp of them over the bridge to the south, so that is a good place to start.\\n\\n'Scouts tell us that they can be found all throughout the Ettenmoors as well, though the best location is at Ost Ringdyr to the east. Get the oil and bring it back here. We'll cook up a nice surprise for the wretches.'",
