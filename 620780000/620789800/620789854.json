When both statues of mighty Elendil once more stand untroubled on the south-west and south-east shores of Tyl Ruinen, I will speak with you again on this matter.\\n\\n'You will need a cleansing draught of some kind to restore the statue the salamanders have ruined. Elves have come to the Eavespires, far to the north and east of Rushingdale, where a stream flows into the lake; they may prepare such a draught for you. I do not know where you may find the missing statue. Perhaps the scavengers of Ost Forod have seized it.'",
