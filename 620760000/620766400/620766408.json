I've named the toad Lobelia, and she's proved quite as ornery as the original, if you take my meaning -- in fact she's grown to be quite enormous!\\n\\n'Well, my Lobelia slipped loose today. She's too big and tough for me to deal with when she's upset, so I need someone to calm her down. Funny, though, she seems afraid of the other toads, so you might have to clear out a number of the toads in the marsh before Lobelia will show herself.\\n\\n'If she does come out, she'll probably be directly north of the The Floating Log -- that section of the marsh is more familiar to her, I think, and she'll probably return there.'",
