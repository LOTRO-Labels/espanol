      "en": "The Riding of Westfold is a land of green-brown grasses and lush woodlands. Three rivers flow out of the White Mountains: the Grimbrook, the Woodwell, and the Deeping-stream. In the west, the land rises to meet the Gap of Rohan, and then drops sharply to the Fords of Isen.\\n\\nIn the south-west, the green grasses run into a ravine in the mountains, the Deeping-coomb, which becomes rockier and narrower as it goes. This ravine is called Helm's Deep, and it is home to the fortress known as the Hornburg, which stands atop the Hornrock.\\n\\nThe Deeping-stream issues from a cavern-mouth at the tip of the Deep. The caverns beyond are the Glittering Caves, full of crystal, flowstone, and deep pools. They are a great wonder.",
