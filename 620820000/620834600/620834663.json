Best of luck!\\n\\n\\nThey have no flesh, nor feathers,\\nNor scales nor even bone\\nBut they do have fingers\\nAnd thumbs of their own.\\n\\nIf you break me, I'll not stop working.\\nIf you can touch me, my work is done.\\nIf you lose me, you must find me with a ring soon after.\\n\\nThe more you take, the more you leave behind.\\n\\nI can run but never walk\\nI have a mouth but never talk\\nI have a bed but never sleep\\nI have a head, but never weep\\n\\nThis thing all things devours:\\nBirds, beasts, trees, flowers;\\nGnaws iron, bites steel;\\nGrinds hard stones to meal;\\nSlays king, ruins town,\\nAnd beats high mountain down.\\n\\nWalk on the living, they make not a mumble\\nWalk on the dead, they mutter and grumble\\n\\nI have streets but no pavement.\\nI have cities but no buildings.\\nI have forests yet no trees.\\nI have rivers yet no water.",
