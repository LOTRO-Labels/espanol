I felt then the gathering of a great company of shadows all about the Stone atop this hill. A group of horsemen stood there, and their leader was grim of face and stern of countenance. Flesh and blood treated with the shadows, and though I could not understand the words, his purpose was plain enough. The company's grim leader charged the Dead with a task, and when the dawn came they departed.\\n\\n'I feel no shame when I tell you I hid myself as they passed, for the men of this company were as real as you or me, but in their train travelled countless shadows.
