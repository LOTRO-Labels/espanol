My men report that something terrible has happened at the Ford of the Isen, and no one seems able to give a clear account. Men are scattered all over the Westfold, and rumours of battle abound. Stay not at Brockbridge! Someone must learn what has befallen in the Westfold. Some say that the King himself is embroiled in the fighting, and may have ridden to Helm's Deep!\\n\\n'A raiding party of Dunlendings has crossed the mountains, and they strike from cover of darkness. Their delight in killing the innocent is unrivalled. Their mark is a winged talon, and the fear of them has spread like fire in the brush. I hope to stand against them, but I have been unable yet to find them. They strike and then disappear, as if they wield some skill borne of magic.\\n\\n'Before you leave, go to the Mead Hall and speak with the Thane. Léoferth is very weak, and the strain of rule has taken a heavy toll on his strength. It is the courteous thing to do.
