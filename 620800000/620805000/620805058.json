Now is the time to strike and reclaim the Jä-koru before they return it to some dark vault in Angmar. It is in the keeping of one of their most trusted captains, a man named Roibeard. He has made camp somewhere within the fortifications of the Ironspan.\\n\\n'I must ask you to infiltrate that fortress by whatever means possible and wrest the Jä-koru from him.'",
