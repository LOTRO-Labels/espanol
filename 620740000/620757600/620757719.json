Well he sent me a message telling me that his henchman, Brunmor, would be after me. He went so far as to tell me that the knave is west and north at some place called the Outlaw's Haven.\\n\\n'It seems all his big talk is backed by this fellow, and if he is to come here, this scant crew will be useless. But you? You've proven yourself over and again! If you can drive off this Brunmor, maybe I can get out of this mess. \\n\\n'Get rid of him for me, and I swear it's the last thing I'll ask of you... and I'll pay you well, too! Apparently, the Outlaw's Haven is west of my camp and a little ways north, with watchposts and a fenced encampment on a hill.'",
