It falls upon the Captain to keep the common warriors focused and able to push forward no matter how long a battle rages on.\\n\\nAs a Captain, you must always have your eye on the flow of battle. Every blow is an opportunity upon which to capitalize. When an enemy falls in battle, be sure to press the advantage with a rallying cry. This will help both you and your allies by giving a boost to your morale.\\n\\nFinally, do not forget to summon your herald to the field. Your herald serves as a protector and carries your standard into battle. That battle-standard serves to inspire all your allies around it and keep spirits high.\\n\\n-T.",
