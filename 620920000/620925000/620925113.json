My fellow soldiers lie dead around me, and I am sure my death will come soon, for it is only a matter of time until another horde of enemies pours through the ford.\\n\\nDo not be sad for me, my dear lady. I feel no pain when I think of you. I only hope against all hope that this letter may reach you someday.\\n\\nMy only wish is that you be happy and brave, and that you survive. Our fair Rohan will prevail! I will not live to see it, but I know you will.\\n\\nBe safe. Care for the people of Marton.\\n\\nGladsúnu",
