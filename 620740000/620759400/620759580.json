In the past, the drakes of Dolroth were drawn here, swooping in and attacking us. After one such attack, I led a band of dwarves into Dolroth and thinned their numbers.\\n\\n'Yet now, seeing as we are hard-pressed by the Orcs, we have no dwarves to spare to remove the drakes, and I fear the drakes' numbers will grow once more.
