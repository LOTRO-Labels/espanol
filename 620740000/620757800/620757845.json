Forget about guards and garrisons. They are nothing to us anymore. Let the constables huddle in Bree and Archet, so long as we own the roads and fields! Andrath is already ours. We will soon have all the land between here and our encampment at Brigand's Watch. Soon we will have all of Bree-land in flames.\\n\\nAnd there's one more thing. The boss is interested in some hobbit named Baggins. Certain riders have been sniffing around asking for that name, and you should look out for it too. If you find any hobbit named Baggins, let me know at once!",
