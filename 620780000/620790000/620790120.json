Against such mean foes as goblins and Orcs, this threat itself is often sufficient to break their spirits and send them back into the darkness unless they are driven by powerful masters -- but not so with the Gauredain.\\n\\n'As Lithuifin has reminded me, Men such as they who are still free of spirit and pride often place greater value upon the unseen and unfelt worlds than they do upon their own lives. The wards were the clue, and it is this that we shall play upon to keep our respective camps safely separated. You may have noticed a number of Gauradan-markers along the shore of the river just north of here. Those mark the current boundaries of the Gauredain's territory -- at least as they see it. But they do not in any way prevent them from crossing further into our stretch of the forest. That we shall now change.\\n\\n'I have changed the wards you brought me and added a few flourishes. If you add these to the boundary markers, they will no longer represent mere territorial boundaries, but Wards of Doom to the Gauredain, a warning that any who cross put their very spirits into absolute peril. The Gauredain may not respect our swords and bows, but this they shall not lightly ignore.'",
