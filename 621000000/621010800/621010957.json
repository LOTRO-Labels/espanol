Though in truth, we Longbeards have histories with both, but that is a thing of scrolls and more than living memory. Of course, I am a Lore-master and know many tales from scrolls. Would you like to hear such a one?\\n\\n'It is known as the Tale of Borin. You see, Durin's Folk have also dwelled here. At the end of this chain of mountains lies Gundabad, where Durin first awoke! But this tale takes place long after that, when our home was Thikil-Gundu and our King was Dáin I. The dragons had gone quiet, and search was made for their whereabouts, for the dwarves distrusted this strange stillness. Thrór, Dáin's eldest son, searched Stormwall but found no dragon. Grór, his second, scoured Winterstith, and too found none. Only Dáin's brother, Borin, had fortune, ill or fair, within the depths of Glimmerdeep, where he came upon the fearsome dragon Etterfang - asleep! Wasting not a moment or a breath, he took his great spiked mace and began a furious assault. Dazed from sleep, the dragon must have thought a host of dwarves assailed her! Gravely wounded, maimed, and bleeding, she threw Borin across the cavern and when he arose, she was gone. Borin returned, having lost his quarry. Whether Etterfang lived or not, stayed or fled, none can say.\\n\\n'If you should go to the Glimmerdeep mine, [placeholder], you might look for signs of either dragon or hoard, and take notes in this journal here. How glad I should be to extend the tale!'",
