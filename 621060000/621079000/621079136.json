But that is in the past, and now, we have welcomed some of our proud bowmen back to Sardol. I only wish more of them had made it home from the War....'\\n\\nSidharan pauses for a moment and sighs.\\n\\n'There are joys still be found, though, and one of mine is a delicious mushroom stew that my neighbour Garthwen makes every so often. Garthwen's a brilliant cook, though she's far too modest to say as much. For her stew, she uses a mushroom native to the Blackroot Vale that we call a silkencap on account of its pale hue. The trouble is that silkencaps only grow in a few places, but they are most plentiful in Lhingroth. I don't think I need to remind you that the spiders of Tarlang's Peaks can also be found within those caverns, but Garthwen's supply has run out. It may not be as dire a problem as the Dead or the Corsairs, but I would appreciate your aid just the same, my friend. Little joys are what keep us together, after all.\\n\\n'Would you collect some silkencaps for me and Garthwen?'",
