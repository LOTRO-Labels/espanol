That one travelled for days and days until we finally arrived at some horrible tower!\\n\\n'I slipped off the waggon before they unloaded it at the gates to the tower, then hid again. Soon, a terrible, robed man came. Some of the ruffians called him Sharkey. His voice was so frightening! Even the Big Folk seemed scared of him. He ordered them to return here, so I hid on the waggon once more.\\n\\n'The true irony is that once we got back to the Shire, those men spotted me and locked me up! Quite a tale isn't it? While those men were scary, I think that robed man is more trouble. I think the Thain should know about this. Would you mind telling him? I'm done with travelling for quite a while!'",
