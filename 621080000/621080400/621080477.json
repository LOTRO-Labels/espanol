I told him it is probably not one of the Great Eagles, because while the flight for one such as Gwaihir or Landroval would not be as long a journey as it was for us, what reason would they have to make it? No, it must be something else. I say he should have filled it with arrows, because anything as large as he describes likely feasts upon anything smaller, and we surely qualify!\\n\\n'I hope in this case I am wrong, and Legolas will not regret his choice to spare this creature.
