It also hints at the strength and heights to which they might again aspire....",

Even so, the story of the song's origin sounds more like some tale out of myth than you are ready to give credence to.",

The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.\\n\\nThe Rising Chord is considered to be a remarkable collection of songs all of a theme that speaks to the heart of the Free Peoples of Middle-earth in one voice, be they Men, Elves, or dwarves. Drawing on the tradition of each of these peoples, the songs resound with a clarion call of freedom and hope that is unsullied by the slightest trace of sorrow, fear, or hate. There are some who claim that this work is shallow and without dimension, but to the adept minstrel, it is a description of form unparalleled by other works. Unfortunately, the book and its strident forms became 'unfashionable' after the fall of the North Kingdom, as a deep lethargy and cynicism crept over the kingdoms of Men, and the Elves withdrew ever further into their forest strongholds.\\n\\n'Nowadays, The Rising Chord is quite difficult to find, and even when a copy is found -- such as this -- it is incomplete at best. Perhaps the famed Elvish minstrel Lindir might be able to tell you more about it.",
