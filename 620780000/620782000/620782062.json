There are a few ways that you can contribute to that cause.\\n\\n'First, continue your battle against the forces of the Enemy...this will ensure that we continue to drive the front forward. Second, assist me in acquiring the materials to make new flags. As each of our strongholds is overrun -- and it does happen, despite our best efforts -- we lose munitions and our flags. The material cost and shipment of new ones would take too long, so artisans amongst us are handling the craftwork, but we still need to gather the materials.\\n\\n'We are only using the hide of the Thistledown-aurochs as they are the creatures least corrupted in these lands. If you are willing, help us collect their hides and return them to me.'",
