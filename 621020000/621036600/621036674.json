      "en": "Dawn, 75th Day of my Exile\\n\\nOne of those wretched drakes crashed through the camp last night, stealing a sack full of goods as well as the tome of my notes thus far. I watched the beast tear the bag apart in midflight, my pages floating on the wind like leaves in fall. They could be anywhere around Elderslade, for all I know. All my notes, lost! All my work, I must recover from memory! I started after the creature, but Galachán was having another one of his fits and I was forced to pretend once more to docility.\\n\\nGloaming, FINAL Day of my Exile\\n\\nWith Galachán out of the way, my missives have gotten through to Dûn Traikh. My findings caused quite the stir, and I have been called back to the town. I gleefully packed up all of my belongings, save my tent. Rákhlazg was upset that I am leaving, but agreed once I suggested Natmoz might be better contained in the tower. The fool still complained that I was leaving his camp underpowered, as if his twenty or so hobgoblins wouldn’t be up to the task of putting down a handful of dwarves.\\n\\nThough dwarves have been spotted in western Elderslade, they will never be able to press furthur to the wall. I will be glad to be back among my own kind. Once they see what I have discovered, we shall see about their thoughts on punishing me over Galachán’s demise. When they see the crystals and the spells and the Wargs… my exile is sure to be at an end. My beautiful Wargs will sing the name of Brágha Fellwinder as they destroy the dwarf forces.",
