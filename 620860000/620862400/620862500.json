He has experienced a great deal of hardship and pain, but he has remained here while all others have left him. All save Frithgeir, that is.'\\n\\nYou explain why you have come and ask Frithgeir about Wadu. He nods with recognition.\\n\\n'Yes, the Dunlending. He came to speak with Nár some time ago. Nár was more aware that night than he usually is, so I marked the visit. The two ventured into the mine beneath these halls. I'm sorry, but I do not remember anything else peculiar about the visit.\\n\\n'There is a brew I can make of several ingredients found throughout Thrór's Coomb. The vapours of the brew seem to make Nár more aware of his surroundings. If you bring me these ingredients, the brew may allow you to speak with Nár directly. I will need several handfuls of the Hulwul-hurz herb, some Nijam-mujdu flowers, and the variety of nut called Kibil-luwz. Take this list of the ingredients and where they can be found.'",
