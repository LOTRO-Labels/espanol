They combine arcane knowledge of the elements with a quick wit to skillfully overcome most any obstacle. They may call on animal companions to fight by their side or use elaborate concoctions to turn the fury of nature on their foes. In fellowships, a Lore-master is equally capable of wielding the natural world against their enemies as they are supporting their allies, through healing and by disrupting their enemies' capacity to fight.</li>\\n\\n<li><rgb=#FFFF00>Lore:</rgb> Lore-masters are seekers of knowledge and the guardians of wisdom. Through study of bygone Ages, they learn ancient secrets that allow them to hinder foes, as well as protect against the dark powers of the Enemy.\\n\\nThis class was inspired by Elrond Halfelven, Elf-lord and Master of Rivendell.</li>",
