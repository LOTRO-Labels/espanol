Now that this barrier will be gone, the robbers will rush to seize what treasures they may. One such band is led by Idella Crypt-breaker, a notorious robber, and she will not remain idle with the promise of riches unclaimed.\\n\\n'Gather allies and speak to me when you are ready to journey to the tomb, and I will show you inside. Confront Idella if you find her within the tomb and reclaim the Silithar for Lord Aragorn!'",
