Seems I'm in a spot of trouble, and I wonder if you could help me?\\n\\n'You see, I've got a couple of cooks who're waiting on eggs from my chickens, but the problem is I've gone and hurt my leg. It's nothing serious, but I can't get out there and gather the eggs them cooks need. Now I don't want to disappoint them, so I was wondering if you could make the rounds and check the nests for eggs?\\n\\n'The nests are just out in the yard. Four or so eggs should be enough. A bit of warning though, don't let the rooster see you gathering eggs. If he does, he'll let out a call that'll get all the hens upset, and worse -- you're sure to be so surprised that you'll drop the eggs you collected!'",
