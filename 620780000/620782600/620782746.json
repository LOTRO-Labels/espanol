The old friendships must be remembered. While Lord Glóin met with Elrond of Rivendell, some time ago, Greip and I were engaged in conversation with an Elf named Gonediad, who seemed learned in the lore of Eregion. Perhaps he can illuminate the matter of Thorog returned to life. Keep to yourself the doubts I have expressed concerning the Elves of Eregion; it will be some time before the old enmities can be fully washed away. Look for Gonediad in Rivendell.'",

I do remember the two of which you speak, for one of them seemed rather uncomfortable when I spoke to him of my studies of the Elves of Eregion. Sigrun, he was called? Yes, that is he. He seemed a stout fellow, but behind his beard I sensed the resentment of his people. Most of the dwarves I have met are more adept at hiding it; he was not.\\n\\n'I suspect the gifting of Mírdanant is the root of this resentment, though it should not be. If my studies of Eregion have taught me nothing else, they have taught me this: the gifts of the Gwaith-i-Mírdain were always made true, and with good intent, though they were as prone to misuse and pretty words as were any good people that walked in those days.'",
