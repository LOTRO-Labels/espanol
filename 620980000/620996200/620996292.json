The blast of heat from the Mountain bent and twisted the doors, and now they cannot be fully shut.\\n\\nSome few passed through before we received your command, but we have now turned away Orcs and Easterlings alike. None will get past us. I will send this message to you with one of my finer runners, may he reach you quickly.\\n\\nKeeper of Carach Angren",
