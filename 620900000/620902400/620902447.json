Let us just say she was in over her head and I came to her rescue. I should not have even been on that island, but you cannot see where life will take you. Hestil did not! That whole business with the unpleasant corsair and the leaking ship... I have not thought about it in years. Cuilinn vowed to write a song about it, but he never did, and... well, now he never will. We met CÃºfaron that year, I believe, in Ithilien, and he followed us first because he lost a game of knives, if you believe it. After a time he came to respect Hestil, and now he would die for her.\\n\\n'I cannot remember what life was like before I started journeying with these people. Less exciting, I think. But even that memory is hazy now.'",
