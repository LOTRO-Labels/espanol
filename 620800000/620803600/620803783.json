It seems that far to the West in the forests of Evendim there lies a grove where one an Ent has taken up residence in his search for the Entwives. Through his Elf-friends he has sent forth a call for aid against a dark menace in the forests there -- some corruption of the wood by a band of Wood-trolls and a Huorn that has fallen under their sway.\\n\\n'I need you to gather a strong following of your companions and make this journey into the western woods, so that this threat may be eliminated before it spreads its corruption further.\\n\\n'Speak with Longbough the Ent when you are ready to begin your assault.'",
