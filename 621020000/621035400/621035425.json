After Gundamári's death, the lordship fell to Fram's youngest son, who had been just five years old when his father died. Gisilhári, who had always seemed less hot-blooded than his brothers, proved to be the most fortunate of the siblings. Under his careful command the Ai-thúda pushed back against the Orcs, winning several decisive battles before finally breaking them and slaying their chief in a great battle by Dvergvát, these very shores.'",
