The dark woods are beginning to awake, and I feel they burn not with the fire of the Orcs but with the long simmering anger. When we do venture there we are sure to plant new trees and respect the forest, but I fear it knows not the difference between us and the Orcs. All it sees are small creatures scurrying about, and all it wishes to do is destroy them.'",
