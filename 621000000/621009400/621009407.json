He did not seem so concerned about the minds of the ravens when Dáin was King Under the Mountain. He must know the truth of it. You see, the line of Carc nears its end. Roäc is dead, his children are dead, and now Arcah, daughter of Croär, is all that remains. I tend her lesser kin as best an old dwarf may, but she is the last chief of the great ravens, and it has been many years since we last spoke in the forgotten ways of Durin's Folk.\\n\\n'She has gone elsewhere... beyond my sight. I do not know if she will ever return, but if the King Under the Mountain wishes to heal the wounds of time and once again share true friendship with the ravens, it will be no simple errand.\\n\\n'I can speak with them if they would still hear me, but they will not listen without the offerings that once adorned their homes. I have seen sparkling trinkets borne by the Easterlings come to the North, and I believe the ravens may find them to their liking.\\n\\n'Bring me those trinkets, and we shall see if the ravens still desire friendship with Durin's Folk.'",
