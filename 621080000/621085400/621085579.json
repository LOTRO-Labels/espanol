My excitement at hearing this could not be contained. Harmelak herself is said to have sampled my stuffed crab creation and then immediately sent a waggon, guard, and coin to see me delivered safely to the city.\\n\\nI hired Phâredar to oversee the collection of materials I require. Please consider continuing to work with her in my absence. If you ever find yourself in Umbar, please seek me out. I would like to thank you in a more proper fashion than with a hurried note.\\n\\nKeteph",
