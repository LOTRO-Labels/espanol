It has been the berth of the ship belonging to Tatháta the Sea-beast, but ever since Nakási Wave-reaper's husband perished in Gondor, she has used it for her own ship as well. I do not know for what reason she chooses not to dock in the city proper, but I believe we will find both vessels in the harbour when we descend.\\n\\n'The way is treacherous, but we can use this rope to descend to the ledge we must take. It is narrow, with only room for one of us to pass at a time. Once you reach the far side of the ledge, there is a ladder that descends to the hidden harbour where our two targets keep their ships. You can go first down the rope... I will be right behind you.'",
