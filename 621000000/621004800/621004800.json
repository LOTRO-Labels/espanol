Is this true?'\\n\\nYou explain that the Watching Stones in Seregost consider Lhaereth an enemy as well, and have allowed you safe passage to and from Seregost. \\n\\n'Watching Stones? Can we really trust such fell beings? We must take the risk.\\n\\n'Here is my plan. I have gathered some soldiers, and more will be coming. They will move into Kala-gijak and create a bulwark there. My hope is that this will trigger an attack from the majority of the forces left in Seregost, and distract Lhaereth from our true intentions.\\n\\n'That is where we come in. We cannot risk a full invasion, even if that were possible, because of the plague. Only the three of us are inoculated against it, and even then, I am unsure if we will survive direct exposure to it in a concentrated form.\\n\\n'We have no choice. The threat to our homelands is too great. We will form a small strike team and enter this den of evil ourselves. Gather some companions, be sure they are inoculated themselves, and meet us in Seregost. We will find a way to Lhaereth's throne room, and do what we can to end this threat. \\n\\n'And no, I will not allow Viznak to come this time. He is but a child, after all.'",
