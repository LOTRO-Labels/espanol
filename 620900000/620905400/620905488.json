So too has she seen the damage love can do: what would learning of Prince Th√©odred's death do to Ingyth, his betrothed?\\n\\n'Nona grew too fond of Horn, over too quick a time, to lose him to battle and death. Perhaps she left to shield herself from growing even more attached to him. Perhaps she simply needs time to resolve her feelings.\\n\\n'I think she will return, [placeholder], but I do not know when.
