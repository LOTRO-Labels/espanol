Just a plain old onion, please!\\n\\nApple:\\nA deliciously tart apple, not the sweet red variety.\\n\\nBread:\\nSeedy brown bread is delicious, and certainly a favourite of mine. I am not feeling particularly hungry for it today, though, so a plain bread will do. Nothing fancy!\\n\\nCabbage:\\nCabbage (large, hearty cabbage) in great quantities is essential for any stew or roast, but I dislike the stuff. None for me, thanks. But if you're cooking, you'll be wanting a large head of green cabbage.\\n\\nMeat:\\nBacon is my favourite meat in all the world. It is actually my favourite food, to be precise. But ever since raising Porkbelly, my prize pig, I just can't touch any form of ham or bacon. No thank you to meat...but I will have it known that bacon is the most delicious food in all of Middle-earth.\\n\\nCheese:\\nCheese! Mustn't forget cheese. Hm, I think I would prefer something rather biting today -- a nice, firm cheese will do nicely.",
