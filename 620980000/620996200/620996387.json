His actions made clear that he is no ally of the Orcs and Uruks in this region.\\n\\n'I think it is best we part ways for now, friend. Rhadrog and I will return to Udûn Foothold and report all we have learned. I will return with enough force to strike at the heart of Seregost. You work with Viznak, discover a way inside, and see what you can learn about this plague he mentioned. \\n\\n'Good luck, [placeholder]. This will be a perilous mission.'",
