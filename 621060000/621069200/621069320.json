You see, there is a terrapin of unusual size living in the ruins at the edge of the murky water not far from here.\\n\\n'Normally she leaves us well enough alone, but recently her little ones have been snapping up all the fish and even snapping at some of our folk.\\n\\n'We know it seems cruel, but if we do not do something soon, we might start running low on food to feed our families. Sometimes we need to push back a little on nature. I am afraid that this is one of those times.'",
