I arrived in Aughaire by chance, or fate, or perhaps random luck! I daresay I don't wish to ponder the long roads that led me in search of my family's history.\\n\\n'My grandfather was a famous explorer, Durell... perhaps you've heard of him? He launched an expedition in search of ancient relics of the north. Though we received one cryptic letter about some of his findings, Durell never returned.\\n\\n'So here I stand, quill in hand. While safe at home, I dreamed of uncovering grandfather's secrets and writing them into a fitting tale, but I fear, having looked myself upon these hills, that I have not the will to seek out the barrow his letter speaks of. He tells of something called the Halls of Night... will you seek it for me?'",
