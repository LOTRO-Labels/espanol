Perhaps he has encountered her before? The Elves can be quite... cryptic. \\n\\n'Regardless, I believe she is the source of the gredbyg closest to the camp, and therefore a threat to us. If you are able, I would ask that you and your companions find her and eliminate her before she finds us and does the same! While you are there, please look for a tunnel that may have allowed her passage from Torech Ungol. I do not expect the gredbyg would have travelled such a distance overland; they must have burrowed through the rocks beneath! If you find this tunnel, collapse it, or more gredbyg will come through.'",
