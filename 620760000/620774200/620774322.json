Your tales have proven to be among the most interesting I have heard thusfar - I have little doubt that I will be able to glean many songs from the stories you have told me and for that I thank you.\\n\\nNow I must bid you farewell [placeholder]. My time here is nearly at an end - no more tales shall I gather from you, for you must stive now solely for the sake of those who remain behind. I hope you will remember us kindly when we have gone, and faded into naught but memories and myths.'",
