I enjoyed hearing the account of your adventures with them before you came to Gondor!\\n\\nI was struck by the words Nona spoke of her lost love Horn, and I am pleased that she liked the sketch I made for her to remember him by.\\n\\nAt her urging I made a copy of the drawing for you, as you were also their companion. I hope you will like it.\\n\\nCaebar",
