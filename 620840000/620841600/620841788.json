Are you willing to stand against foes that have long risen up against the Men of Middle-earth, threatening to tear us out by our roots and make this world over in the grim visage of evil?\\n\\n'I think you are willing and able. It is for this reason that I ask you to make your way north along the Greenway to the place where a pass cuts towards the eastern hills. There, in the ruins of the Greenway Fort, you will find one of my brethren. \\n\\n'His latest reports tell me of a great danger growing out of the north, and he is in need of much assistance.'",
