We would welcome your continued aid, but if you feel the time has come for you to continue your journey, I would suggest that you speak with Ringhul, marchwarden of the High Moor. Let him know that I sent you and tell him of your deeds... friends of Rivendell are always welcome.\\n\\n'To reach the High Moor, you should return to the Tâl Bruinen road and take it north all the way to the main road in the Bruinen Gorges. Follow the main road east to the Ford of Bruinen and cross the river, turning south. You will find a path that leads up into the hills... this will bring you to the High Moor and Ringhul's post.\\n\\n'Farewell, [placeholder].'",
