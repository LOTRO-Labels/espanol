It is a credit to the work ethic of our shipmen that the Sail-haven looks scarcely different than it did before the War—or the Mutiny, for that matter. As the new master of the sailors' guild, it is my belief that meals should sometimes be provided at the expense of the guild's coffers. Let our shipmen keep their wages for their own!\\n\\n'To that end, I have prepared a number of meals for hungry shipmen in the Sail-haven, but I simply do not have the time to deliver them myself. If you could deliver them on my behalf and offer some words of encouragement to our shipmen, I would be most grateful.\\n\\n'What do you say, [placeholder]?'",
