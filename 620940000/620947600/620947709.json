The lynx which dwell upon the High Moor have become feral -- no doubt due to the shadow rising in the East. Unfortunately, they pose a great threat to those who journey to Rivendell seeking refuge.\\n\\n'However, there may be another possible cause that I would have you investigate. Stinging sickle-flies have begun to come up from the riverbanks, bringing the threat of disease...but their incessant stinging might also be a cause for the lynx' aggression.\\n\\n'Perhaps if the sickle-flies were purged, the lynx might find peace.'",
