I hope you will visit Thorin's Hall to taste some of the glorious beer they have brewed this year, for it is said to be so delicious that folks go mad for it. Also, do not forget to try the new horse races in Bree and the Shire. Here is a formal invitation for your perusing pleasure.\\n\\nPeace and best wishes ,\\nOpal Goodbody",
