That was long ago, and the soldiers of Gondor could conceive of no mercy for the sons of Castamir: I am certain they were all slain.\\n\\n'I am troubled by this title, however, for it means whoever is using it knows how to manipulate the Corsairs. Evoking the name of Castamir in this way is a highly-effective means of mobilizing the enemies of Gondor. There is more behind this increase in Corsair activity than there has been in the past. These Heirs of Castamir may not be heirs in truth, but they certainly intend to continue the legacy of trouble he began, so long ago.'",
