We know from our spies that the Barkhûshim remnant is quartered in Dûl Zidur, to the east. The Barkhûshim hold no love for history, and destroy anything not related to their fallen lord. They burned much of our written history in Kûr Anzar, and we have no reason to believe they won't destroy this cache as well.\\n\\n'Those artifacts hold great significance for all Shagâni. They reveal our history, our culture, and provide important lessons for us, mistakes we should not repeat. Please, go to Dûl Zidur and secure these precious pieces of our history. Defeat any All-seeing who try to stop you. We are counting on you.'",
