Nearly all occupants of Tharbad, Dol Ernil, and Gond Orchal succumbed to the plague, their bodies requiring burning instead of the usual barrow internment. Fearful of the sickness passing to the living, the bodies were burned in huge pyres without the usual ceremonies. It is said that the sky above Cardolan was grey and that ash fell for days upon the land.\\n\\nThe ashes of the victims were gathered and transported here, mixed together and dumped by the grieving survivors, who then piled stones atop the mound, in hopes of keeping angry spirits at rest. There is no record of the names of the dead, for they were too many in number, and most of those who put the bodies to the torch fell themselves to the illness.",

Most fearsome of these was a wraith-like figure known as Hithrengor, the Grey Fear, who terrorized Dol Ernil. Luilloth brought her young son Ostir to Fornost for his protection while her husband, Prince Ostecthel, hunted down the source of the evil.\\n\\nPrince Ostecthel strode into the fog a mighty warrior in his prime... only to later stumble out looking as though he had aged decades. With gasping words he revealed that the evil had been banished and that the land was safe once more. Aggrieved but proud, Luilloth returned and served as princess-regent until Ostir came of age. The people loved her, for she was good and kind, and ruled wisely.\\n\\nOstecthel's words were soon proven wrong, however! Once more, the Dead rose and ravaged Cardolan, while Ostir and his few remaining knights fell back, retreating north. Is it not known where Luilloth had been, but tales say that when Ostir and his army did not return, she set out to aid them. She found only her son's loyal canine howling among the Downs, and Luilloth knew then that Ostir was dead, for Astoryn would never leave his master's side.\\n\\nLuilloth and Astoryn went north to seek guidance, following whispers of some great power that dwelt in the forest. She was never seen again, but the ravening Dead quieted soon after and vanished back into the mists.",
