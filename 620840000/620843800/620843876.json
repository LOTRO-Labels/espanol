Only the most experienced of riders will be able to master such a tricky path in the amount of time we have allotted.\\n\\n'The rules are very simple -- race through each gate, and you mustn't fall off your steed before the time runs out. When you see two gates next to one another, you must choose which path to take, be it high or low. The low path may be muddy, and the high is sure to be dry, but precarious indeed. There will be other hurdles to disrupt you as well.\\n\\n'Do you feel up for this challenge? Only the most spirited riders should even attempt such a feat! It is sure to be very dangerous, but you have a hardy look to you.'",
