I thought him slain during the Enemy's assault on the walls, but no man, beast, or siege has been able to fell him. He stalks the wreckage on the field just to the north, and revels in the slaughter of any in his path.\\n\\n'Meanwhile, I have heard word that three MÃ»makil are being driven towards the gates from the east. They ferry many Southrons forth, and pose an immense threat to the folk within the City. For my own part, I would see them slain for what they did to Duinhir's sons... and the countless others who have met their doom under their heavy foot-falls.'",
