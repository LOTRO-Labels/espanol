      "en": "Seventh of April, 1351\\nWe discovered a cave two days ago as we returned from our raid upon the treasuries of Rhostham. Khedem fell into a hole in some loose soil and broke his leg. We splinted the wound and cleared out the entrance. The cavern beneath us is vast, and seems to go on for miles.\\n\\nNinth of April\\nAfter some spirited debate, which ended with a few lost teeth and one cracked skull, we took a vote and decided to move our base to these new caves. It lies near a major trade route and will keep us hidden when the king's men come sniffing about.\\n\\nThirtieth of April\\nAt last, the gang has finished moving our gear below ground. It troubles me that others might discover the cave mouth as we did, though. Perhaps we can build something on top of the entrance to disguise its purpose.\\n\\nFifteenth of July\\nThe entrance to the cavern has been sealed beneath a wooden house. Tawult, our tinker, has fashioned an intricate secret door to gain entrance. It should be nigh impossible for interlopers to discover these caverns now!\\n\\nFourth of August\\nWe almost lost Shutet today. Whilst digging in the caverns, the floor collapsed under him and he plunged headfirst down some kind of underground water channel that emptied out into an enormous cave. After he crawled back to us, he claimed he felt fresh air, but he took a rap on the head so he may be mistaken. Tunon will investigate tomorrow.",
