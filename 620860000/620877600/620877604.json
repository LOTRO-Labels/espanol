We need not fear that Grawulun or others of his kind will return to that place.\\n\\n'But Gorothúl may have left other relics of evil throughout Moria; indeed, I think it likely, and recent reports from our scouts indicate one such location: the Mirror-halls of Lumul-nar. Merrevail have corrupted the mirrors of Lumul-nar that once fed light from the outside into the deep reaches of Khazad-dûm; the light no longer shines. A number of explorers ventured to Lumul-nar to investigate. Few returned, reporting that the merrevail of that place have been given great courage; their defiance is strong. What else have they been given, I wonder? A relic of Gorothúl's?\\n\\n'The entrance to Lumul-nar is on the side of Zirakzigil, amid the snow. Find the relic inside, if it exists, and destroy it.'\\n\\n<rgb=#FF0000>NOTE: This quest is a Solo version of the dungeon.</rgb>'\\n",
