You have done a good thing for the city, my friend. I will send guards to apprehend him and put him in the lock-house for this transgression.\\n\\n'I do understand his motivation for this, however. I will send good men to find his family and ensure that they are provided-for, and that they are counted when the food-rationing begins. Still, let their father's sins be a lesson to the young ones that honestly carrying-out one's duties is the better way to serve the city, the Steward, and the Council. Perhaps the longest siege of all is that waged against a man's honesty and sense of duty by the events of these dark days.\\n\\n'Thank you, [placeholder], for your role in this matter.
