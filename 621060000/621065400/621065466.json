Furthermore, he was no coward... to what foe would he turn his back?'\\n\\nNearly without pause, Meneldir answers his own question.\\n\\n'Aye, [placeholder], we know the answer already: the creeping shadows Aberthol saw that night in Herne, one of which sat astride a great black horse. I named the creatures, once, and now I do so again: Nazgûl. Such a foe would inspire fear in even the stoutest of the Dúnedain, and such a foe might even ride down a fleeing man to slay him with a sword-stroke to the back. It would be as nothing to such a creature.\\n\\n'Sarn Ford is to the west of here, and it seems that might be the site from which Narndir fled. There have at times been a few Rangers at the ford there, though never in great number. I think we should divert our course to Sarn Ford and learn what might have befallen its defenders.'",
