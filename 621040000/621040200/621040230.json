I have remained in this chamber ever since, casting my dreaming gaze over the mountains, watching from afar the trials of the dwarves. I say it was mercy, for truly I deserved a usurper's death, but so too do I call it punishment, for I was unable to intervene or aid them in their struggles.\\n\\n'On rare occasions one of those I watched would seem to catch a glimpse of me, but never in my own form. Was this a cruelty of the First Crafter, or some confounding jest? I cannot say. But this I know: only once did he to whom I spoke hear my words.\\n\\n'It was Durin who heard me, Durin who returned again and again with new visage but the same spirit in his breast. Only Durin heard my words, my friend of old who showed me the mercy I did not deserve. So often had I sought to aid the dwarves in their trials, and so often failed. But when Durin stood before the Anvil of Winterstith I spoke to him of Gundabad and his right to rule the Mountain-home for all dwarves, and he listened. It must mean something. My long penance nears its end, and the prolonged hours of my dream must soon pass away. Soon I will wake, and Mótsog will be no more.'",
