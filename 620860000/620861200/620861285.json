The Inn League has grown, but only in response to some rather unfriendly competition from the Ale Association, which is the new faction of the dwarves.\\n\\nDo not forget to visit the Taste of Hobbiton or the Thorin's Hall Keg-race. There is also fishing in Bywater... but I do not wish to spoil it all for you. Come to the Party Tree, and I will give you a better explanation myself.\\n\\nSincerely, \\n\\nOpal Goodbody",
