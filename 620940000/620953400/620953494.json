Yes, I miss my wife Halwen and my son Dervorin greatly. I must lead this Vale again so that my son will have a place to come home to. What is the difference between losing your home and death, I ask you that?\\n\\n'Please take my word to Laerind and let her know that I am deeply sorry for my reclusiveness and I cherish all that she and Arvaethor have done of late for the Vale. I bestow Laerind and Arvaethor with command over the Vale until Dervorin returns to take over my reign. Now I must rest to regain my strength for the coming days.'",
