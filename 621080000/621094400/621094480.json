It is a forest haunted by tortured spirits!'\\n\\nThe woman is very distraught and is anxiously wringing her hands.\\n\\n'She said the trees there have wood that is better for woodworking and would be worth a fortune. I told her not to go, but she said, \\qI am no pashâg!\\q and that she would return in three days. That time has passed, and she has not returned! Did she anger the spirits? Did bandits attack her? Please, go to Arwáth and see if she is well. Nobody else will do it!'",
