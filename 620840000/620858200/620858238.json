My husband Celeborn has called for a great company, the Golden Host of Lórien, to cross the river Anduin and bring battle to the fortress of Dol Guldur. It stands atop a stony height in the depths of Mirkwood, and behind its walls great evil is brewing.\\n\\nCome to our lands, and prepare to fight this growing shadow! Speak to Haldir of Lórien on his flet just outside the Golden Wood, or to the boat-master Calengoth, standing vigil on the south-eastern docks of Lothlórien, on the Great River itself.\\n\\nWe have need of great adventurers such as you, my friend. Please come to Lothlórien, from there to depart for Mirkwood!\\n\\nLady Galadriel of Lórien",
