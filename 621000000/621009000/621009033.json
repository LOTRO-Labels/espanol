By His command, I devised pains and torments unequalled in any of the Ages of the world.\\n\\nBefore the Mountain raged, I was the master of all that transpired within the iron walls of the Direhold. I was the greatest of the Dark Lord's torturers. But on the day the Mountain was rent asunder and its fires cascaded, when the iron walls of Naerband became not just a prison, but an oven.

I need some new captives.",
