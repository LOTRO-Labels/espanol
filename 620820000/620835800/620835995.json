You need to do something truly worthy of song.\\n\\n'As you continue to fight for Lórien, I will devise additional challenges that might rightly live on in song; successfully complete one of my challenges, and I will be sure to give you a reward in addition to what Belvagor will give you.\\n\\n'My sister Limhendeth has always been fond of Belvagor and expressed to me her concern that he might be wounded during the upcoming battles with the Orcs. My challenge to you is this: do not allow Belvagor to be so much as scratched. He is an Elf brave and true and will demand to fight at one of the passes, but for my sister's sake, ensure that he is not wounded. You must win the battle without Belvagor sustaining any serious injury to complete my challenge.'",
