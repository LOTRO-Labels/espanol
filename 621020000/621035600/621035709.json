There is some unholy power in these sarrowstones that seems responsible for the mutations in the Wargs you have been battling.\\n\\n'I have crushed a few of these stones on my anvil and the corruption dissipates like dust when they are destroyed. I hear that you are heading north to battle more of the enemy at Malkorlash. Whilst there, shatter any sarrowstones you come across, my friend.'",
