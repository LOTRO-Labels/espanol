Crystal Bolger, up in her tree, spoke of a delicious smell that drew her to the farm, and Gladiola said something similar. Andy Boffin said the smell began so deliciously, but turned so foul when he started eating that it knocked him out with the power of its stench.\\n\\n'I held my nose shut with one hand, and though my eyes watered furiously, I investigated the main farmhouse. There's an evil-looking creature back there, [placeholder], and I think it was he who brewed that terrible poison! I think he was using it to lure hobbits into his trap, and Isenbard Bolger is still missing! That creature must still have him captive.\\n\\n'He muttered to himself almost constantly. It seems that his name is Thad√∫r, and his poison is called Darkthorn. You've got to stop this evil creature, [placeholder], you and your friends! You've just got to!'",
