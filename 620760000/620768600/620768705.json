They may summon a Herald companion to fight by their side, ensuring they always have an ally to buff. They can also Mark foes, giving benefits to all who attack them. In fellowships, a Captain supports his allies with healing and buffs, while still dealing respectable damage.</li>\\n\\n<li><rgb=#FFFF00>Lore:</rgb> The Captains of Middle-earth hold the future in their hands. By their own strength of arms and the inspiration they instill in others, they must lead the Free Peoples to victory.\\n\\nThis class is inspired by Eärnur, last King of Gondor, who was revered both as a captain skilled in arms and as a lore-master.</li>",
