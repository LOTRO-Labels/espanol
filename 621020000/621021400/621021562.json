She seems to ignore you, barely acknowledging your presence, but then turns to you and speaks.\\n\\n'We meet again, [placeholder]. I have need of your aid.'\\n\\nShe seems completely untroubled by the questioning of two very powerful Elf-lords. She turns to gaze at the ruins of what must have been a grand dwarf-fortress before its ruin. She does not hide her melancholy as she reminisces.\\n\\n'Once, the dwarves dwelled here in great numbers. They busily toiled below, sang songs, feasted, lived their lives. We had an understanding, and though I did not appreciate it then, I enjoyed their company. But now they are gone, at my bidding. It was I who flooded this place.'\\n\\nShe notices your shock and confusion at this admission. You feel Elrond and Glorfindel's stances change, and see their faces harden. It appears Elrond's suspicions were justified.\\n\\n'Judge me if you wish, for I failed. I did not achieve what sought. On that day, a great darkness stirred beneath the mountains. The ground shook, and new paths opened deep below. I felt the taint of evil seep ever closer. I could not allow it to corrupt the Gladden. I bade the dwarves leave, and called forth the flood-waters. Dark, twisted things lurk in the depths now. They did not drown, as I had hoped. I merely halted their spread. I am not able to defeat them on my own. Perhaps with your help, I may finally be able to set things right.'\\n\\nYou ask what became of the dwarves that used to occupy this place. Indignation briefly flashes across her face.\\n\\n'I would never have let them drown by my hand. Whatever befell them after they left the shores of the Gladden was beyond my control. My wish was for them to live their lives happily in other halls.'",

Indeed, something troubles me still, and my thoughts dwell on the years following the War of the Last Alliance.\\n\\n'In the early years of the Third Age, Khazad-dûm was still a thriving kingdom. Durin's Bane had not yet awoken. Despite this, I have memories of dwarves seeking refuge fleeing from a mining colony in the mountains at a time when all should have been well. It was known as Kidzul-kâlah. Many dwarves were waylaid on the road by Orcs and goblins as they attempted to reach Durin's halls or other nearby forts. They told us of a great flood, perhaps the same flood that caused the Gladden Fields to become the marsh it is today. Perhaps it is as simple as that, an earthquake and a flood....\\n\\n'And yet, I cannot help but think the Maiden of the Gladden may be involved. The Gladden is her domain, and the waters would answer her call. I would like to travel to Kidzul-kâlah and question Gultháva myself. I would ask you and Glorfindel to accompany me. We will travel to the Gladdenmere and seek her. Find us there.'",
