I regret I can tell you nothing about this relic that you have not seen for yourself; the type is familiar to me, but I do not know what it may mean.\\n\\n'I can tell you what lies beyond the sealed door in those caves, however. Long ago, when the kingdom of Rhudaur was at its height, evil Men worshipped dark powers at a temple in the wilderness. The route overland to the temple has not been taken in many years and is surely overgrown; I have dispatched scouts from time to time to search for it.\\n\\n'I believe that the sealed door leads underground to that temple, [placeholder]. It is said some terrible thing befell the Men of Rhudaur within its walls. Let it remain sealed, for now. If this relic signals a return of that evil, we may need to take action; but for now, let the temple remain lost.'",
