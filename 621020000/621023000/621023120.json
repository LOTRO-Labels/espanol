Few of our soldiers are equipped to take down such monstrosities on their own, let alone the great hulking troll Fuluk. He is stronger than the others, and he crushes soldiers beneath his fists just for the amusement of it! He is a formidable foe.\\n\\n'If you think you can help with our troll problem, slay a few of them and be rewarded, but do not expect a single coin while Fuluk still lives. We need our soldiers uncrushed, and while he stalks the battlefield that is no certain thing.'",
