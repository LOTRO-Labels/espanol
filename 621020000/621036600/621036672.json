I stashed a few shards in the Orc and hobgoblin tents, but to no avail. Next I shall try them on the nearby dragon-kin that prowl the fields above the camp. I thought to leave one by Galachán's sleeping cot, however making him stronger, more violent, and madder would perhaps not be the best of plans.",
