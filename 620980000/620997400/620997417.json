Now listen closely, as I have not the strength nor will to repeat what I am about to say.\\n\\n'I do not know why only the most important and awe-inspiring bits fell to earth while much of the city remains. Dulgabêth the Black Word, known to you as the Mouth of Sauron, has claimed what still stands of Barad-dûr. He has many followers, myself once included. Now Dulgabêth seeks to rule all of Mordor and take Sauron's place, by use of powerful relics buried within the tower's walls. None will oppose him. His faithful servants are not to be trifled with either. Glúrugoth, the Hole-warden. Sapakár the Cleaver. Krassa-phûrsa, Bringer of Tears. These are all names that strike fear upon mention.\\n\\n'Do you now possess the knowledge you seek?'",
