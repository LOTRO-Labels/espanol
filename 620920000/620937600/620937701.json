Taking command of these weapons, you can choose ammo with which to load them, aim them, crank them, upgrade them, and fire them. If you have an ally with you, they can aid you in any of those actions, or do one of their own. The actions you have available, and the efficiency with which you perform them, can be unlocked and upgraded through the Promotions tab of the Epic Battles panel.",
