They looked like they didn't want to be seen and kept peering over their shoulders back in the direction of Bree. I thought at first they were here to look for turtles at my prime turtle-catching spot, but then they started talking. And their words! Oh my!\\n\\n'They spoke of a group that has infiltrated Bree and is gathering strength, watching and waiting. And when they are ready, they are planning a surprise for the village, one the Bree-folk will not soon forget! \\qQuick-wit Culver's sharpening his blade,\\q the seediest looking Man said, \\qand Twisted Garrett has all the rope we'll need.\\q\\n\\n'They left after that, but not before discussing the password the infiltrators use to get into their hideout. It's \\qAnother infiltrator is here!\\q and if you say it to their door-man, you can get inside and stop this before they are ready! Their hideout is in Bree, south of the High Stair, and their door-man stands out front. Stop them, [placeholder]!'",
