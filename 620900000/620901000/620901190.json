I do. The Orcs did just that, and when they were done, I begged for death myself...only the creature which led that band -- an Orc called Matumkâr -- would not allow them to grant me my wish. I was allowed to bury what remained of my children, but my wife I never saw again.\\n\\n'[placeholder], if naught else comes of this horror, I ask only one thing: see to it that Matumkâr perishes at Thornhope. Let my family have the justice they deserve!'",
