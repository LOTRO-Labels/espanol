I am here to gather some of the elanor that grows so brightly upon this hill; an extract of the juice from its stem and heart make a marvellous golden-yellow colour. The creation of pigments and paints is an art unto itself, nearly as engaging as the uses to which I and my fellow-artists put them. Unfortunately, it is time-consuming... unless -- if you had some time to aid me, it would be most appreciated.\\n\\n'You have not the knowledge of refining the raw ingredients, but you could help gather them. Stark white chalk can be pried out of the soft white rocks all along the rock-face north of here. Berries from some of the local plant life provide the base for a vibrant red dye. These bushes grow in relative abundance in the forests west of Cerin Amroth.'",
