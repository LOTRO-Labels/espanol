In the Mirror we saw two possibilities of what might come. We may abandon our strife against these foes, and their power will grow and grow. Or we may snuff them out... but be ourselves ever -- diminished. I cannot say, precisely. I could not see as clearly as I have been used.\\n\\n'For in truth, some of my powers are failing whether we war against Dol Guldur or not. This ring that I revealed to you just now was forged in the same days the Dark Lord forged his One. Though it was ever hidden from him and its own power kept safe, still the rings were tied. Celebrimbor, for all he did, could not sever that bond, I am afraid. Now that the One is no more, all the others fade and falter. I doubt I shall ever see clearly within my Mirror again, and much else shall be lost to me.\\n\\n'Still, I would pay the price again, in a heart beat.'",
