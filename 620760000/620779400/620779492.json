Choose your professions with care, because you will expend a great deal of time and energy improving your skills!\\n\\n'Once the Mistress of Apprentices has welcomed you to your chosen professions, be sure to speak with the Provisioner within the Craft Hall. She can sell you the tools of your trade -- every profession has its own, so be not overshy with your coinpurse! The novices will be happy to sell you any recipes you might wish to have, though I can tell you now that you will already know how to make a thing or two.\\n\\n'Equip the crafting tools you plan on using and find an appropriate facility -- the Craft Hall has a forge, workbench, and oven available for your use -- and begin practising your skills!
