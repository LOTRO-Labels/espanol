It is a slap in the face of every Dúnadan that those stones stand within our city.\\n\\n'We cannot hope to tear the monuments down...they are too large and we are too few. In the time it would take us to destroy them, they would have us surrounded with more warriors than we could possibly defeat. No, the answer is subtler.\\n\\n'We will take the monuments and claim them for ourselves. There are six spread throughout the city. Once we find them, I will protect you while you fly a flag of the Rangers from it. We will turn their monument into ours.'",
