You see, when those wolf-men attacked the waggon, he wasted no time at all: he broke open the crate of figurines and started throwing them at them. While they were distracted, he crept by them down the path and escaped into the woods! He got turned around, or he would have stopped at Echad Candelleth to see the Elf Tongannel again, but he was already nearly to the Last Bridge when he regained his bearings. He came home, bemoaning the loss of the figurines, and I put him right to bed to rest.\\n\\n'But you have recovered the figurines he meant to sell! He'll be so pleased. I think I will forbid him from making another such journey, however -- we will sell them here in Bree, and that will be more than enough. Though I must say, it is too bad that about the poor man you found... whoever he was he should not have died so.\\n\\n'Here, take one of these figurines back to Tongannel. I know that Tim will be touched by her thoughtfulness, and he will want her to keep this as a token of her friendship with the Strawleys.'",
