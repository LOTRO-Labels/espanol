No, not a hobbit, but one perhaps of the little folk, or river folk, as they were sometimes called. Yes, there were some songs that told of Fram's friendship with a strange, Elfin folk in those lands who only revealed themselves to children; perhaps these songs were nonsense, as many such rhymes tend to be, but the resemblance between the Elfin folk and the Hol-búdlan of old cannot be ignored. You have heard tales of the Hol-búdlan too? Perhaps this is worth investigating!\\n\\n'If there is any such remnant of the Hol-búdlan left in Misthallow, it will certainly not be in this valley. No, they most likely hid in the hills. There seems to be a path following the river, just east of here. Let us venture up it and see what we can find!'",
