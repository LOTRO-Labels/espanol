      "en": "Wolves have long been a scourge of the peaceful River Hobbits of Misthallow. In hard winters, they often stalk the Wells of Langflood—and the Vales of Anduin to the south—to prey upon livestock and to threaten the River Hobbits themselves in vicious packs. Nowadays, though, one must wonder, for they have strayed from the North in larger and larger packs, and they seem more than just hungry—there are rumours that many of these packs were bred by some new evil to be particularly vicious, to prey upon the unwary and the meek, and to sniff out those who would mean to hide from the eyes of the Enemy.",

Whatever it is that has driven them down from the forests and hills of the North holds more fear for them than the clubs and arrows of the River Hobbits. Perhaps the greedy creatures' hunts have borne little fruit in recent days, leaving them no choice but to seek for new prey in more distant lands. You would think that if they had the slightest sense at all, they would head back up North to the plentiful lands of the Wells of Langflood. On second thought, perhaps it would be better if they did not trouble the River Hobbits more than they already do!",
