The crops for Forlaw were going to be ruined! The eldest son of Gárwig, Gárnoth the Brave, heeded the call for help and rode out to slay the Warg. It was an epic battle, and he drove the Warg away, but was mortally wounded in the process. The Warg was believed to be dead, until it re-emerged in the past year, and roams the south-west fields once more.'",
