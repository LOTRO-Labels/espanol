Gondor ruled in Umbar. Ambarûl was but a poor country with little trade or wealth. There was a revolt in Umbar...  warlords soon came to Ambarûl and demanded our people take up arms and follow them to battle against Gondor, which we did. Our soldiers were among those who seized the Gondorian lands of Damarzâg. We then crossed the River Kaskûr to invade Ithilien.\\n\\nThe foreign generals treated us cruelly, marching us past endurance and forcing us to be among the first into battle, that we would be the first to fall. One day, it was if a glamour was lifted and... rose up against our masters along with many other soldiers. Tired of dying on Gondorian swords we were. Seeing the King of Gondor and his armies arrayed against us... killed our masters, threw down our weapons, and quit the field.'",
