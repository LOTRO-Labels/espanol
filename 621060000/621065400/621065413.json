They have so far kept the lad from bothering me as often as he used to, which is nearly payment enough, if you ask me!\\n\\n'Nearly, I said. Peace of mind doesn't put food on the table, but luckily for you, coin does. So you pick whatever you like, and no cost to you.'",

He will not greet me warmly, and I know not where he will be found, but this warning must be delivered all the same.
