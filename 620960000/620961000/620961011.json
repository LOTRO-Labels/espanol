A number of other worlds will be closing and their inhabitants will be moving to the worlds that will remain, including this one. At the same time, the servers that power our worlds are moving and being upgraded. As a result, the remaining worlds will be able to host more players with improved performance.\\n\\nWe hope that you will extend a warm welcome to the newcomers and help them feel at home here. Some small gifts have been placed in your inventory in thanks for your patience during this transition.\\n\\nWhile no action is required of you during the server consolidation, all transfers are free during the event. If you wish to transfer your account:\\n1. Detach any items from your in-game mail that you wish to keep\\n2. Choose a remaining world or worlds for your move (see the list below)\\n3.
