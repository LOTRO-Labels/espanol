You have the look of a wayfarer who has walked many a long road, and I wonder if perhaps I could convince you to walk another in my stead.\\n\\n'In the normal course of things, I should be on my way to Lake Nenuial, in Evendim, to serve for a time in caring for the old Dúnedain manors and crypts found near Annúminas. Truly, for most of my brethren, this duty is a pilgrimage to the past, to another time when Arnor was a great kingdom that ruled all these lands in peace and prosperity.\\n\\n'However, what with the amassing Orc-army just on our doorstep, I will not be able to make my journey just yet. I would ask you to seek out Calenglad at the Ranger-camp on the island of Tinnudir, just off the east shore of Lake Nenuial, and give him my regrets and this explanation.'",
