It is a story, nothing more, but one that may have merit.\\n\\n'When Rhudaur pledged to serve Angmar it is said that some were gifted rings that gave them command over their lessers. These rings, borne by the most powerful leaders signified their stations, but came with a terrible price. Each of them perished and were replaced by wight-spirits.\\n\\n'Likely, it is naught more than a nursery tale, but if it is not, then the power of those rings must be removed. Seek out these rings, if they exist, and bring them to me so that they may be destroyed. The wight-leaders will bear them.'",
