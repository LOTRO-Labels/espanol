      "en": "'When the Great Southern Empire of Ordâkh dominated Umbar, the conquerors brought their religion with them. The Ordâkhim worshipped a mysterious figure they called He-Who-Sees-All, and it is clear now that this must have been the Dark Lord Sauron. During this time, the Corsairs were directed to prey more and more upon Gondor. Years ago, in response, a great hero of Gondor attacked the city, but while it may have slowed the attacks upon Gondor's coastline for a time, it also stoked the flames of hostility. When the War arose, Black Númenóreans calling themselves the Heirs of Castamir were quick to heed the commands of Sauron.\\n\\n'I blush to admit that I served the Heirs of Castamir, as you know. I wanted nothing to do with a Dark Lord or with aiding terrible forces of evil! I just wanted someone to tell me what to do. Many of the Umbarrim may be the same. I understand the Temple of Sauron that was once called Mâkhda Khorbo has fallen into ruin and is now called Mâkhda Dahak!\\n\\n'What is the difference? Oh... let me see. It is basically like changing 'this is the place of the All-Seeing One' to be 'this place is the place of lies.' That is not something the Dark Lord would allow, surely, so I think it means he is well and truly gone.'",
