Hunting in Forochel is serious business. Hunting requires patience, stealth, silence, cunning, planning. If you can prove that your feet can be silent as your mouth is not currently being, you may prove more than completely useless, and we will talk again.\\n\\n'We hunt härkä. There are several herds of them nearby; look to those to the south-west and to the north. Those thrice-blasted Susi-väki have been sneaking around recently, trying to trap our härkä, and they are not too careful about how much damage those brutal traps of theirs might do to the poor beasts before they come to put the wounded out of their misery. Go and find those traps and disable them. Härkä can be somewhat skittish, so stay calm -- if you hurt one, the whole herd might run, and then you may be certain I will use your bowels for a bow-string.'",
