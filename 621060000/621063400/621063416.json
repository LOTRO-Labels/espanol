It became clear to me as well that he was dawdling; he seemed in no real hurry to reach the Havens at the end of his road.\\n\\n'\\qPerhaps you wouldn't mind painting something for me?\\q I asked him, and he said it had been many years since he had last painted a subject of hobbit-style. \\qHow many years?\\q I asked, and he would not say. You know how Elves can be. At any rate, I thought this would be just the thing to give to Angelica: a painting of her new house!\\n\\n'And here it is!'",
