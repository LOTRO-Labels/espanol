He disappeared in the vicinity of Helm's Deep, which means she would likely travel there in search of him, and the King dispatched messages to Erkenbrand, who lives there. If Sigileth went that way, she is sure to be on her way now to Gondor. Would such as she dare pass the Paths of the Dead? I understand she survived for weeks beneath the dungeons of Dol Guldur? It sounds to me as if she fears nothing!\\n\\nYou should speak with Duinhir at his home in Morlad, in the Blackroot Vale of King's Gondor West, to see if she has arrived.",
