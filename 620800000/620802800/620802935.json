There are too many beasts in the forest, and there are not enough hunters to collect our supplies for the kelkka.\\n\\n'You can help us by collecting moose-antlers, sinew, and driftwood. The antlers are important, you see.  They are flattened into the luisua of our sleds, keeping them light but ever so strong. Most any moose you hunt in our forests should provide you with a generous amount. The sinew comes from the wolverines all around Kauppa-kohta. Their meat is too tough for eating, but perfect for lashing the kelkka together.\\n\\n'There is something strange about the driftwood, though. The lake cares for it, cradling the timbers until they emerge on the southern shore like smooth gems from a Kivi-v√§ki trader's pouch. The wood glows like the moon, and because the kelkka are formed from it, they will always guide us back to our homes. My people depend upon the kelkka to take our goods from village to village. Your help will be greatly appreciated.'",
