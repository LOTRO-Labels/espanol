To dismantle the trap, you will need a powerful rune-stone of your own to protect yourself from the searing flames. I can craft that for you with the right reagents, but, you will also need to track down the original chisel used to carve the rune-stone! Aye, the ancient dwarf-craft is not easily undone. Here, let me write this down for you. Good luck in your search.
