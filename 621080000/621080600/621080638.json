The name Umbar comes from the word Umbru-mâra, the Fruitful Land, but its position on the southern side of the Bay means it was greatly desired by many, and often changed hands. It was a colony of Númenor; it was the southernmost port-city of Gondor; and it was briefly held by the Kingdom of Hamât which ruled in Near Harad before the Great Empire of Ordâkh came up from the south and conquered both.\\n\\n'Much of that is ancient history. If my brother Jajax were here, he would tell you that Umbar came into its own when the city became the City of the Corsairs, and its children preyed upon any fat vessel that dared traverse the waters of the Bay bearing jewels, wine, gold or silver. He would tell you too that the rich merchants and rulers of the city would take their portion of the Corsairs' plunder, and the wealth would pool in the coffers of those who already had plenty. He would speak at length about this!\\n\\n'After the War, Umbar is now ruled by a fellowship calling itself the Kindred of the Coins. I have told you what my brother and I learned about them, little as that may be, but you have assembled a mighty crew and I trust you will be able to deal with them!'",
