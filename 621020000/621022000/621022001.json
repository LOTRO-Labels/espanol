As the master of fortifications, the responsibility falls to me to ensure that the king is satisfied by the state of them. But that is no easy task, for Díngarth was the first encampment we constructed after the Alliance pushed through the ruins of the Gate, seven years gone. It has been repeatedly assailed by the forces of Sauron, and rebuilt anew following the worst of the assaults.\\n\\n'Isildur rules Gondor with his brother Anárion, at the behest of their father, the High King, and there is no end to the worries upon which they must dwell as the siege drags on. King Isildur would not trouble to return to Díngarth if he thought our business here unimportant. He must know, as I do, that if the forward positions of the Alliance are pushed back, Díngarth will become our only foothold in the Black Land. To face defeat after such cost of lives and years would be impossible to bear!\\n\\n'So I ask you to gather wood and stone from around Díngarth and patch up the fortifications.
