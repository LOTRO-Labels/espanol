You must understand, however, that the Rangers are brutes in their own right and have long been a menace along our borders. Ask those in Trestlebridge and the farmland of the North Downs, and you will see the same response to the Rangers. Not a single one of them can be trusted.\\n\\n'As I said, there are others within Bree-land who need assistance and you have proven a valuable ally and more than capable combatant. I would have you visit one of these folk. Adso Haybank is a hobbit building an inn along the Great East Road stretching between Bree and Buckland. He has sent a message that brigands are stealing his materials and threatening the lives of his workers. If you would, please visit him and see what can be done. I will continue to think on an alternate course of action. \\n\\n'You will find him west along the Great East Road, south of this cabin, between Bree and Buckland.'",
