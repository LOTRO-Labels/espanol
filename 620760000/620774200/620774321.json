I hope your wanderings have not proven too difficult in recent days, but I have collected rumour of a number of your more recent quests and travails in the lands of Ered Luin - but I would prefer to hear them from you first-hand. While rumour moves swift as the wind and is doubtless more amusing than fact, I prefer to know the latter before crafting my songs, particularly when they must weather the tide of ages among my people in the far halls of the West.'",
