It is said that his wickedness was so great that it drew all manner of foul creatures to the surrounding lands, not the least of which are the vicious wolves that have long troubled the River Hobbits of Misthallow. Has such a thing come to pass yet again? Do new evils stir in the North? Whatever the truth of it, it seems an ill omen that now wolves can be found across nearly all of Middle-earth.",

On second thought, perhaps it would be better if they did not trouble the River Hobbits more than they already do!",
