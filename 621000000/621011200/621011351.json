The Mithrin worms claim them as well, and do not willingly surrender their hold! Strike them down and show we are, as ever, to be feared!\\n\\n'But I urge caution in one respect. Worms of a reddish, coppery hue will put up a fight but can be bested. But if you see a worm with ice-blue scales, you may have found Holkorm, more ferocious than these others. He may be a worm of a different brood; I cannot say for certain. I offer a reward to any who can rid these mountains of Holkorm and thin the ranks of the Mithrin worms that threaten our expedition.'",
