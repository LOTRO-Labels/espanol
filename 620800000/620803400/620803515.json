Yes, they who wear the pelts of their pets. It used to be that they were no real trouble, as their haunts were far from ours. Recently, however, I have had reports from Scout-master Lauri that Gauradan-fetishes have been spotted within the northern exit of the Jä-kuru, the ice-canyons that lead to Taur Orthon, south of here.\\n\\n'The Susi-väki use fetishes to mark the extent of territory that they claim or intend to claim as theirs. With these, they now threaten our main route to the south. Go and destroy some of those fetishes -- that should throw them into some confusion. If it keeps happening, they shall soon enough get the message that their incursions will not be tolerated.'",
