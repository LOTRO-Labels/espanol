You will earn trait points as you level.\\n\\nThe first step is to choose a 'specialization' for your class. Each specialization comes with some initial perks and a unique set of trait bonuses that will automatically unlock when you spend points in any of the three trees. Even though bonuses and the final tier of traits are exclusive to your specialization, you can still spend points in trees in which you are not specialized.\\n\\nYou can change your trait spec, re-spec, or purchase new traits at any time outside of combat, so feel free to experiment to determine the combination that works best for your style of play!",
