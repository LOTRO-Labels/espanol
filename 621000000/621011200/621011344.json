You might be able to see further than in the low-lands, but the thin air makes it harder to hear sounds from far away, especially with the wind whistling among the rocks the way it does. I didn't hear the hawks until it was nearly too late. They flew down from the heights, clawing and scratching, trying to get at my eyes. My hands are covered in scratches, but at least I kept my eyes! For now, anyway, for now! Cursed birds!\\n\\n'I will give a reward to any who slay the grey hawks of the Ered Mithrin, especially the largest and foulest of them. Keenclaw I have named him. He will never have my eyes, no matter how much he desires to dine upon them!'",
