This place was pretty quiet when last I scouted these tombs, but there has been a flurry of activity here of late. And it's not the Angmarim, it's the hobgoblins! If I had to venture a guess, I would say Loknashra has taken leadership of the hobgoblins that were spared the control of the Dragon Voice, and has sent them to the tombs. Hórin did say she swore revenge on everyone, right? I think they might be eager to turn our resting ancestors into their foot-soldiers!\\n\\n'We have no other option but to go in there and stop her.
