One of these tales concerns these very tombs: according to legend, the lords of Gundabad will one day rise from their crypts and walk once again among the living. When they see the evils perpetrated by the Orcs in Gundabad, they will unleash their wrath upon those who despoil the great dwarf-halls, slaying their enemies from sunrise to sunset. Then, when their day of reckoning is done, the great lords will return to the Houses of Rest and slumber again for eternity, the Mountain-home made free of their foes.\\n\\n'<rgb=#00FF00>Look</rgb> out over the Pit of Stonejaws, [placeholder], and tell me what you see.'",
