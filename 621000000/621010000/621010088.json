I now lead them into the Grey Mountains and onward to the halls of Thikil-gundu. It is not Thikil-gundu that I seek to reclaim, but rather the treasure-hoards of Durin's Folk that were lost in its fall. I do not doubt the King under the Mountain chose his words carefully, and he spoke of increasing the wealth of Erebor as a matter of chief importance. After the failure of the Iron Garrison, what better source of wealth can be found than within our delving of old in the Grey Mountains? The King under the Mountain forbade such an expedition, and it is clear that I will not be welcomed back to Erebor as a hero of Durin's Folk even if my quest succeeds. You have always been the more adventurous one, brother. I hope that you understand where others may not. For Erebor!\\n\\nNori",
