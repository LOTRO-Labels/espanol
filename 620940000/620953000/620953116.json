I would give anything for this victory, my friend! The gratitude of the Steward would do much for my family's position.\\n\\n'Long ago, the peace of Gondor was threatened by Wainriders from the East, cruel men who rode down their enemies in great wheeled chariots. It is said that Ondoher, one of the last of the true line of Kings, faced the Wainriders in battle on the great plain but was defeated. No sign was ever found of the King or his force, and Steward Denethor believes that the Wainriders might have driven him into the Dead Marshes before he perished.\\n\\n'You think it unlikely? I would say so too, but for this. Denethor had of late a dream, in which he beheld the banner of the King flying proudly against the night sky. Could it be the banner of Ondoher, last of the line of Kings descended from Meneldil, An√°rion's son? The strange waters of the swamp must have preserved it, after all this time, and I must find it and return with it to Minas Tirith!\\n\\n'If these Orcs have found the King's Banner, they might be keeping it in a storage cache in their camp. Return to their camp and search these caches to ensure they have not!'",
