It was a beautiful town that was sacked and destroyed utterly by the Orcs of Mordor. I, like so many others, fled in terror as our home burned.\\n\\n'As I ran, I dropped a precious pendant, an heirloom of my line that had persisted from the days of Eorl. Knowing the nature of those detestable creatures, I would assume they shattered it along with everything else. Yet, I have hope that it remains.\\n\\n'If you would, travel to the north, near the remains of Hytbold and see if my pendant still remains. I will reward you with everything I can spare should you find it intact.'",
