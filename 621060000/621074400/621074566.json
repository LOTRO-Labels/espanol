But you know it well, don't you?\\n\\n'From what we have learned, High Priestess Ásachal has stolen a shard of the ancient Oath-stone of Rhudaur, Tauressar, and brought it to Angmar that she might wield its power as her own. It is said that it was corrupted by the hand of the Witch-king himself, and that oaths sworn upon it bind the wills of its victims to the Oath-stone. Even so far from the battle in the south-lands, our tribes learned of the Witch-king's doom. Does Ásachal truly mean to master the Oath-stone in his absence? It must be destroyed before it is too late!\\n\\n'Although we cannot be certain, it is likely the shard is now kept in the highest chambers of Gwathrenost. We have cleared the way, my friend. It is up to you now!'\\n\\n\\n<rgb=#FF0000>NOTE: This quest tracks your progress for the Tier 1 difficulty of 'Gwathrenost, the Witch-king's Citadel'. While underway, it allows you to resume adventuring in 'Gwathrenost, the Witch-king's Citadel' at the furthest checkpoint you have reached in each reset cycle.
