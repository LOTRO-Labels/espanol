      "en": "'Following his retreat from the Battle of the Pelennor, Gothmog fled to Imlad Morgul and the safety of the Dead City. Did he attempt to weaken the bridge west of Minas Morgul, as both Isildur and the Lord of the Nazgûl had once done? I cannot say for certain. I destroyed that bridge to protect us from further assault, but it occurs to me now that there was another result of my action: so too did I protect Gothmog from further assault by us. The western approach was blocked, and he needed fear no attack from that direction. He then sealed Fennas Gost, not to protect himself from us, for we had not yet entered Mordor and he had little reason to think we could, but to protect himself from Sauron, and from Sauron's servants.\\n\\n'Why would they wish him ill? That is easy to see, [placeholder]. He commanded the loyalty of his own thralls, but there were other forces in Mordor that would deem him a failure, perhaps even a traitor to Sauron. Had he not suffered defeat after defeat in his guise of Mordirith, failing to achieve victory in the North? As Gothmog, had he not then suffered defeat on the field of battle before the walls of Minas Tirith? Yes, there are many in the Black Land who might question his loyalty, and none so greater than Sauron himself. Had the Quest of the Ring not succeeded, had the Dark Lord not fallen, who is to say what Sauron might have done to punish Gothmog? But Frodo did succeed, and Gothmog was given a reprieve, brief though it was.\\n\\n'I believe he searched the dungeons and hidden chambers of Minas Morgul for some weapon that might reverse his fortunes.

It was the king's wish that we help Prince Faramir make safe his lands, and so here we are.\\n\\n'I was charged with scouting the old libraries of the city, a sad errand. It was Valardis, Isildur's queen, who assembled here a great library of Númenórean lore. But the books of Númenor were burned with the coming of the Nazgûl, and when Queen Valardis learned of Isildur's death on the Gladden Fields, she never again came south. What few records escaped the torch were brought to other archives in Gondor and Arnor; the libraries of Minas Ithil never again thrived as they once had, and when the Nazgûl once again claimed the city, they filled the ashen shelves with tomes of evil and scrolls of foul ritual.\\n\\n'I entered those dark archives and found them accursed. They are touched by a sickness, [placeholder]. I do not mean a pestilence such as that which befouls the swamps of Agarnaith in Gorgoroth. It is no plague. Nay, it is a sickness of the mind. I walked those aisles and beheld dear friends of mine, now departed, as if they lived still. Celairant...'\\n\\nMithrendan shakes his head.\\n\\n'No, it was not he.
