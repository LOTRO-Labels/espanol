The guards of the city in days of old wore these badges to signify their posts, but I am grateful that we have not maintained that tradition. If the Steadfast Sisters were consigned to their own posts, they would not have come here to Ariant when they did, and Olcránnag might have escaped to work further evil. Truthfully, there is no man save Elessar alone who might be able to command the Sisters and have them heed it, but still I am glad that wardens and Rangers go where they are needed, not where they are assigned to be.\\n\\n'Where next will you go?
