I told you of the hillside caves my friends and I explored as children? I know every tunnel and passage of them, not just from those explorations but from nights spent hiding in the dark when we feared Tornhad was threatened by foes seeking the eradication of the Dúnedain. I know why we did not stand and fight... but sometimes I wish we had.\\n\\n'I will uphold my oath, without question. But it is my small hope that doing so will bring me to distant lands I have never seen, to face dangers that no man has faced, and when my duty is done to hear it said that I did well. Is that too much to ask? I hope not, my new friend. Thank you once more, and may we see each other again... far from here!'",
