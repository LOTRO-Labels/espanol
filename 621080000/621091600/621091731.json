It's important for keeping the peace that citizens don't lose faith in the Kindred after... recent events.'\\n\\nA darkness begins to creep onto the man's face before he shakes it off and returns to the present.\\n\\n'Since the re-opening of Dâr Laja, some of the residents of the Sail-haven have come to me with their troubles, as they currently have no representative on the council. They tell me of crocodiles coming out of the city sewers and causing trouble in the streets. Apparently, someone has lost a beloved pet.\\n\\n'I have dispatched a few guards from the Fleet-fast to go there and assess the situation. I suspect that there is more going on down there than just wandering beasts. I happen to have some familiarity with these tunnels, as it is where Mêshka and I were forced to hide for a time to escape the fires of the All-seeing's priests. The beasts in the tunnels underfoot are content to stay there so long as they are not disturbed. Something else is causing this.\\n\\n'If you would like to continue giving aid to the people of Umbar Baharbêl, I am eager to receive a report from my soldiers there. You can find them by entering Umbar-môkh through a door between The Wharf-gate and The Fisherfold.'",
