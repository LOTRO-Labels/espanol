The name of that sword perhaps derives from the feeling amongst some of the Elves that their time in Middle-earth draws to an end, and perhaps is an allusion to the direction of their retreat. Who can say?\\n\\n'At any odds, the tale says the Elf's sword may be found far to the north, not all that distant from the place my kindred have made for themselves to spy upon Carn Dûm. I believe the sword's hiding place is in a lair of great and terrible spiders. No one adventurer would be able to retrieve the sword alone, so once again I must counsel you to seek allies in your quest'",
