But here is what I know.\\n\\n'I have heard that the Steward of Gondor, Denethor II, awoke from his slumber one night with the vivid memory of a dream. What the dream may have been I never learned, but whatever it was compelled him to propose that Imrahil command his daughter Lothíriel to wed the Steward's son, Boromir.\\n\\n'This rightly gives good folk pause, for Lothíriel and Boromir are first cousins, and such close marriages harken back to the dark days before the fall of Númenor, when kin married kin, and much harm was done. Imrahil disapproves of the notion, and I understand that Boromir does as well, but neither man can refuse the Steward his request.\\n\\n'Lothíriel has stated she will consent to the marriage, if she must, but the prospect makes her unhappy, and I have heard she has been stealthily leaving the city to seek the advice of the Elves.'",
