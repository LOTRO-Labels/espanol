Unfortunately, with the coming of the False King, those fell things have been awakened.\\n\\n'Perhaps the worst of the creatures which dwell here are the fell spirits, demons which have existed in Middle-earth since the First Age of this world. At the height of the Witch-realm of Angmar, the Witch-king had power to command these spirits, and it is said there are other creatures which have a similar power. It was these spirits that the Witch-king sent to the Barrow-downs after the passing of Cardolan. It is these spirits who stir the bones of the dead.\\n\\n'I bid you to go west into Imlad Balchorth and confront these demons. Claim the Tokens of Angmar they carry. Perhaps we can use the tools of the Enemy to banish the fell spirits from Middle-earth.'",
