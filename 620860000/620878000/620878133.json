Two nights ago, a small band of riders joined us from the fields of Rohan, and glad I was of the additional men and horses...but alas, just this morning, I learned that one of the riders was a passing acquaintance of mine, and a much-beloved kinsman to Théodred, my prince.\\n\\n'Dunstan is his name, and it seems he came here hoping to prove himself in battle...yet he wears too few years upon him and does not understand the peril of our position here.\\n\\n'I need someone to retrieve him from the front where he and his men rode, and quickly, for I think there is little time left before the Dunlendings make a move against us...then it will be too late.'",
