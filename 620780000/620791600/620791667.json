I think they are taking the spiders and cooking them down, making them into that tar of theirs that they throw! Never heard of them using spiders' innards for such a thing, but wouldn't surprise me a bit.\\n\\n'They are probably sore from their defeat south of here and are itching for another fight. But this time they plan on burning hobbits out of house and hole! You've got to put a stop to this!\\n\\n'You should head back to the Bleakleaf Crest and burn the pots they are cooking the spiders in -- they'll probably have torches or such nearby that you can use. And you'll need to take the recipe for the tar away from them as well, or burning the pots won't do any good. Defeat one of them hobgoblins out there and search him for the recipe!'",
