After an ill-advised attempt at humour, King Thorin requested that you deliver word to the leaders in the North.

Far from the hale foe Thranduil once faced, Iphantemel was old and bloated in her excess and she seemed to welcome her death. The spiders were at last purged from Eryn Lasgalen, but only because Ungwetári called her children to the Ephel Dúath for some terrible purpose.
