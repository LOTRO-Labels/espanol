The time has come at last to sail to Mithlond and to blessed Valinor!\\n\\n'We have waited only one month, but each day has seemed a year since we arrived in Celondim. The burdens of this realm shall soon be behind us, but I am curious if the sons of Elrond found what they sought in the ruins of Edhelion. I have heard many tales of the sorrowful history of that place, and how it came to ruin by the hand of a disreputable dwarf named Skorgr√≠m Dourhand, but it has laid empty for many long years now. I wonder if anything remains to be found there....\\n\\n'I have never walked upon the shores of the blessed realm, but I have heard many tales of Valinor. Your forebears who once dwelt there, did they not? Did you as well?'\\n\\nTaerthon pauses a moment and studies your face.\\n\\n'You look restless, my friend. What troubles you on such a joyous day?'",
