The Enemy is gone, but the things He set in motion may not yet have dissipated.\\n\\n'Whether there be one shade or two at work in the Vales of Anduin, I advise you exercise caution. Whatever may be the truth of it, stories can change over the years; who can say what the original kernel may have been? Vagári the Wanderer may mean no harm to Woodmen or to Beornings, or to those who travel in their lands, but remember that even in the original story, Marhairu Winter-hair was taken from his home for a year, and returned greatly changed. Ill intent or no, his life was altered by that encounter, and I should judge not for the better.\\n\\n'I miss my library, [placeholder]. If only I had access to my books, I might say more!
