I'm from the Shire originally, but I've relations in Bree and more often than not I've found myself stopping part way from Buckland to Bree for thirdsies or second brunch and thought of starting this outpost during one of my stops here. I asked Mr. Butterbur for a little help in getting the inn stocked, and my friends Larkspur and Hawkling came to help me. We've got the inn built but my stock is just where it needs to be to meet the demands of my visitors. If you're willing to help me make this a right proper place, I'd be willing to give you a fair bit of coin. Mr Butterbur needs to be given a large parcel of boar meet that I borrowed from him. I owe him twenty for the fifteen he gave me.'",
