The creatures are cowardly, but in great numbers even the weakest of foes can pose a threat.\\n\\n'The ruins of House Brumbar are north and east of Tinnudir, in Parth Aduial. Cross the bridge to the mainland and follow the shore northward. Brumbar is little more than crumbling walls now, but we can not allow the boggarts to befoul its memory.'",
