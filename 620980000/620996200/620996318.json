When I escaped Durthang, I thought to build my strength, find my allies, and rain destruction upon my jailors and the great multitude of my enemies. But it is not to be!\\n\\n'I went first to the Isenmouthe, but the guards would not let me pass. I then went to my old camp, home to my servants and my sworn men both, and found it hostile to me! They have given Ortakûl the command, and all my servants and all my sworn men look upon me as a coward, as an unwelcome stain upon the Khundolar! Conspirators and ingrates, all of them!\\n\\n'I sat down here by the road, once-mighty Ayorzén fallen so low as to have no place in all the world. I am not welcome in Gorgoroth. Even the Orcs spit upon me! And there is no place for me with my own kind, despite my long military service and impressive chain of titles and deeds. Ortakûl has seen to that! And Gondor? Do not make me laugh, vile pursuers! Gondor would not welcome one such as me, and I care not for that invading land anyway.\\n\\n'I have been waiting here for you to catch up and put an end to this miserable day. I surrender to you; do with me what you will, but if you levy death upon me now, you will shame yourself and all you claim to honour! I am Ayorzén, twice-imprisoned, first by one side and then by the other. What do you call yourself? [placeholder]? And he is Annoth? I have heard more impressive names; truly I have worn them myself!\\n\\n'Do you want this trinket? It is of no use to me. I stole it from the vault of Durthang, for I thought it might be useful. Yes, I wanted a valued artifact to barter with some self-important, greed-blinded fool.\\n\\n'You can have it, [placeholder].'",

He is a surrendered man, and the tale he weaves is one of despair whether I believe it is truthful or not! If we were to slay him now, we would be no better than Ugrukhôr, who betrayed the Thandrim!

That our other enemies have cast him aside does not absolve him of guilt for his crimes!\\n\\n'As for the trinket he gave to you, I think any study of it should be reserved for Mithrandir. I feel a great deal of evil emanating from it, and shouldn't the Wizard ensure it is not a devious trick of Ayorzén's before we accept it? It is a small curio, easily held in one hand, and its design is not of Mordor. I think it was fashioned elsewhere. It may be that its stay in the vault of Durthang has imbued it with the unpleasant aura that surrounds it. Bring it to the Wizard and see what he thinks, [placeholder].'\\n\\nAnnoth sighs, clearly disappointed with the result of pursuing Ayorzén.\\n\\n'I suppose we have to bring our captive out of Mordor.
