Ever since the Iron Crown made their way into these caverns, its creatures have been unwell, and I am afraid the glow-worms of Ormgren are no exception. Whatever balance was set in place long ago among these creatures has been broken with the warding-runes, and there is no craft or magic we possess that could repair them before the hour is too late!\\n\\n'While I am thankful that many of the worms are still docile, a few have grown aggressive. They've begun to harass the miners and gnaw away at the ancient columns of Gloomingtarn. One among them, Thrastring, has even taken to devouring his own kindâ€”and I worry he might develop a taste for dwarf too if we're not careful!\\n\\n'If Gloomingtarn is to survive even after the Iron Crown are routed, we must put an end to Thrastring and his ilk.'",
