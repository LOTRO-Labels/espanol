We sought fame and glory and riches, and took on modest quests for even more modest treasure. But the treasures dried up as war approached, and it seemed there were fewer people looking for adventurers-for-hire and more people looking out for their own skins.\\n\\n'Before any of us knew what had happened, we had a lore-master who couldn't stay focused on any single thing for more than ten minutes, a guardian with more bravery than sense, and a warden extolling the virtues of some long-since-fallen city and decrying us our comparative lack of such virtue. And no one to pay us.'",
