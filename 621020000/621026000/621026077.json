This place is home to Khatlob, the massive, voracious brood-mother of the roost. At least, so say the Orcs; it sounds from their talk that she laid the eggs from which sprang the terrible flying mounts ridden by the Witch-king and the rest of the Nazgûl.\\n\\n'She is not the only danger within. The lower reaches are said to be guarded by Khúrthak the Rent, a great Olog that has long stood guard over this area... and over Khatlob. It sounds to me as if he is both her jailor and her protector. The Orcs say he suffered a grievous injury from her claws, and now fears to get too near.\\n\\n'Such beasts that Khatlob bears can work great evil upon our forces in Imlad Morgul, and elsewhere. When you are prepared, you should follow the path and put an end to the brood-mother and her terrible spawn!'",
