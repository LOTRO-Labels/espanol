Something spooked the goats, and I climbed up the ridge to investigate... and that's when I heard it.\\n\\n'Something was... how can I describe it? It was a sniffling sound, like someone with a cold. But there was something about that snuffling sound that made my blood run cold, and as I approached the milling goats, I saw that I was not the only one disturbed by the sound. The eyes of the goats were wild, and they stamped the ground, desperate to get away from... something.\\n\\n'Something moved among them, low to the ground. It made no sound but that snuffling, as if it was smelling for something. I ran. I ran and ran, and I feel as if my heart has only now calmed itself. If you decide to visit the goats at the enclosures to the north and to the south-west, use caution! That thing might come back!'",
