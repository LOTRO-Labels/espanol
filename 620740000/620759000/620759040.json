Once Skorgrím is restored, he will resume his mantle of leadership of the Dourhands. A fitting thing, I think... for a place of eternal rest to be the site of dark rituals of rebirth.\\n\\nAs you foresaw, there were complications with the body's retrieval after that bothersome troll's interference, but the dwarves were able to acquire Skorgrím's remains using goblin workers - a clever ploy that enabled them to dig in the Silver Deep without the Longbeards' knowledge. Until then, I await your orders.\\n\\nYour faithful servant,\\n\\nMarrec",
