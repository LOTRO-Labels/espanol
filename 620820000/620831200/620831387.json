Word of your valour and courage has reached my ears, but seeing as I am a disbelieving sort, I would like to see if you are made for the sort of challenge I have to offer you. \\n\\n'Many great and wicked things nest in the rot of Skûmfil, [placeholder]. One such great creature is the kergrim-king, Grimreaver. The corpses of the Orcs nourish his minions, and he grows strong and corrupt on the rancid flesh of our enemies.\\n\\n'If you are truly all that they say you are, you will go to Skûmfil and face Grimreaver, patron of evil. I want you to bring me his fang as proof that he is dead. This will not be an easy task, but it is not impossible. There is no shame in bringing friends with you on this venture.'",
