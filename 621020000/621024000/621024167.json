The first four pages also reference Ivar, Thadúr, Ferndúr, and Drugoth, four of the gaunt-lords. There is a fifth and final page of writing that lists the name, Gortheron. No notes have been taken on this page. You believe the Witch-king may have been attempting to create a new set of gaunt-lords to command and locked it away here. Luckily his work seems to have gone unfinished. It is good that you were able to defeat these gaunt-men before the notes were discovered by one of Sauron's former servants.",
