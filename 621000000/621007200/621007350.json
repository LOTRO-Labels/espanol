At first, he pleased himself with simply parading through our camps, knocking things over and cuffing children on the ears. But soon his swagger grew greater. He began suspecting us of imagined crimes, rooting through our belongings and taking what caught his eye. He beat any who stood in his way, then any who so much as looked him in the eye.\\n\\n'And then, one day, he took what was most prized of the Chayasír: my memory-cloth,  or in our tongue, Bilitang. That with which I sing the memories of our mothers and fathers, and of their mothers and fathers before them.\\n\\n'At last, we fought back. We knew no good would come of it, but he had gone too far.
