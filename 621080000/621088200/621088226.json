Unfortunately for him, it was not a productive trip. Far from it. Seems he was harried by great beetles on one of the northernmost Shield Isles, Ghax-hophra. He was so afraid he left his notebooks, which contain a lifetime of research into Umbari life and culture.\\n\\n'For his sake and ours, we need to get those pages back. Will you venture out into the Shield Isles and retrieve his research? While you're there, destroy the nests of those vile creatures, that they may not harm others.'",
