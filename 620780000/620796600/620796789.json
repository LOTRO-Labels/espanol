I am not certain what it means, nor am I a scholar wise enough in this foul tongue to know what it truly says. I know only that we must deal swiftly with these Wargs.\\n\\n'Return to Goblin-town and hunt them down. Kill as many as you can and then return to me. I will see about getting these writings translated.'",
