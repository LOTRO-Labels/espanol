Tis true that darkness dares not intrude upon the Last Homely House, as it is well guarded against the forces that now grow upon the land - but beyond the bounds of this place things have become trecherous indeed.\\n\\nIt is with some astonishment that the High Born have watched your progress throughout these travails, and it has encouraged us considerably to see that even should we pass from this world, there will remain those who have the spirit and strength to see these lands.\\n\\nIt is even said that Elrond himself has entrusted a matter of the utmost import to a simple band of mortals, though what this task might be, I cannot say. Perhaps you will discover the truth of it yourself, in time.'",
