Descriptions of the pools and gardens of Glinghant hold a special place in the hearts of my people. Even after the long years of decay, you could see the memory of its beauty.\\n\\nThe coming of Amarthiel and her legions to Annúminas is cause itself for sorrow, but of all the harm they have caused to this city, their possession and despoiling of Glinghant stirs me most to rage. I would cast them out of this place and restore the splendour it had of old, even should the rest of Annúminas fall. In that, I am not joined by most of my kindred, but such is my horror at the spoiling of Glinghant.\\n\\nAmarthiel has many servants, but to Glinghant she has sent the darkwater: foul spirits of corruption. If you should venture beyond the gate into the terraced steps of Glinghant, I would account you highly should you defeat them.",
