I like how near grow the delicious fruits, the smell of the sea-breeze, and the sound of the waves on the shore nearby! But do you know something? The ideal nesting place is one where you do not need to stay all the time. I have the spirit of an explorer, just like my friend Sirgon, and I cannot stay here forever, ever, ever!\\n\\n'Some of the other birds I have spoken with in this land talk about a ship that is crewed only by animals! Perhaps I will seek that one out if I get tired of life on land! That would really be something! Thank you again, again, again!'",
