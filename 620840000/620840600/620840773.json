Our scouts have examined the tower of Minas Gîl -- you can just make it out on the slopes to our east through the mist -- and they have returned to me with tales of deadly spirits of shadow surrounding it, and a shadowy ward upon the door that prevented them from gaining access to the tower's interior.\\n\\n'I do not yet know what transpires within that tower, but it reeks of the Enemy's sorcery, and we dare not ignore such a threat so close to the path of our advance. Fuirgam has tasked me with ensuring that the threat is dealt with, and so I turn to you for aid.\\n\\n'To begin with, can you do battle with the spirits surrounding the tower and bring me some aspect of their being? They are almost certainly bound up with the ward upon the tower itself, and if I can divine its nature, then we may be able to break it.'",
