      "en": "Be it known that Zôreth of Lûghash is thus expelled from the Order of the Eye for the keeping of spies to be used against us, her continued attempts to wrest the dwarf-king from his prison, and most terribly, for the supreme transgression of dishonouring Sauron the Great. It was the will of Lord Sauron that the dwarf-king remain in the dungeons of Barad-dûr, and so he shall until his days are ended. Indeed, the dwarf-king has been more obedient as of late, but I do not trust his sudden change in demeanour. He and the spies of Zôreth plan some deception - I am certain of it. Those of you within the Order who serve her still shall cease at once, or you will share the fate of those we have exposed and be cast into the Black Pits of Mordath! Zôreth is an unfortunate loss to the Order, for her skill in the manipulation of spirits served us well, but neither she nor any of her other malformed dwarf-servants shall again pass into Barad-dûr. By the will of Sauron, her fate is chosen!\\nKeep a close watch on the Flaming Spire -- and let none of her servants come to Barad-dûr!\\n\\nLady Abrazaphel",
