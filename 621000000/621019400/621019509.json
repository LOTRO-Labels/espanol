Did you find this leader at C么s Braen? No, of course you did not.\\n\\n'Here is my guess, [placeholder], and while it is supposition only, I believe you did not encounter this leader because she was away searching for the source of this mysterious call! After I departed Rhosgobel, when the woods grew too dangerous even for a Wizard, many spiders descended upon Rhosgobel. They took over the old Elf-ruins and turned it into a vile den of spiders. Could something about those spiders be calling the Ungoledain leader to Rhosgobel? Let us return to my home as soon as possible, and find out for ourselves!'",
