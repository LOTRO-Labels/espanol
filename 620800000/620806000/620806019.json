His sale of fish and fishing supplies has been much diminished, and I worry for him and his family. He is very skilled in matters of the rivers and waters for a Man; his prowess almost reaches that of Elrond's folk.\\n\\n'If you wish to find supplies, I would ask that you visit Garbert. He should be at his cottage in Tâl Bruinen, south of here, near to the river.'",
