We encamped not far south of here, in a place I later learned was called the Snares, and with good reason. As we slept, our camp was raided by spiders! Only I escaped and was rescued by these Rangers.\\n\\n'One of my companions was bearing a pouch of valuable gems on his person, which we were taking to Othrikar for trade. I do not doubt that it was still on his body when the spiders dragged him off. Could you go to the spider-lair and retrieve it? Without it, I will be destitute. The lair is to the south of here.'",
