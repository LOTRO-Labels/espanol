If it were not for you, we might still be troubled by those terrible water-spirits, and worse yet, we might still be beset by the Corsairs and that so-called Heir of Castamir who took up in Tarlang's Crown. And now, I hear tell that you've become one of King Elessar's emissaries after serving in the War. I say it is an honour and one well-deserved, no matter what some others in the Vale might think of the new King of Gondor. A fine honour, indeed!\\n\\n'I'm afraid there isn't much trouble about at Sardolâ€”at least not like there was during the War. I've heard that some of the Corsairs and some deserters have made their way to Tarlang's Crown, but it'll come to nothing, I think. \\n\\n'It may not be much, but I could use a little help today, if you can spare the time in the course of your errands for King Elessar. Would you check the nets near the pier for fish and bring me whatever you find? I've been coming up with small fish all day, so I don't want to let the big one swim by while I'm not paying attention!'",
