There is value in preventing collateral damage, or sometimes in inflicting it.\\n\\nThe Merit Bar indicates the grade (iron, bronze, silver, gold, or platinum) you would earn if the quest were to end and how close you are to the next grade. Quests start with either full, partial, or empty merit. The events that give positive merit are listed below your bar in green, with events giving negative merit listed in red. Your current objective completion percentage is listed next to the quest name and is multiplied by how much merit you have.\\n\\nThe better grade you earn on a quest, the more points towards rewards and Promotions you receive. If you are having trouble earning a higher grade, try acquiring more Promotions or changing the Promotions you are currently utilizing.",
