But it was a lonely song, for my sisters had gone away and I did not think I would see them again. Animals came to the stream to drink, and birds to bathe, but except for such creatures I was alone and felt the pain of it... until one day.\\n\\n'An Elf-maid tarried by the river as she journeyed southward from a distant land. She was more beautiful and radiant than anyone I had ever seen. I sang to her and she delighted in my song, for it reminded her of home. She danced beside my stream, and I was so gladdened by her presence that the music I made held more enchantment than ever it had before. She slept on the bank of Gilrain, comfortable and safe, and I was no longer alone. I dreamt that once she awoke she would fashion a home for herself in my wood, and I would teach her my song and she would call me sister. She would have children of her own, Elf-children of merry eyes and high voices, and I would show them the flower-fields and the secret springs, and they would fashion brightly-coloured petal-crowns to wear, and their mother would delight in them.\\n\\n'It was a happy dream, but it lasted too long, and when she at last awoke many seasons had passed. The Elf-ship that waited in distant harbour for her to arrive could wait no longer. With selfish hands I stole that life from her, and I grieve every day at the sorrow I caused her. I did not intend such sadness to befall, and I would take it back if I could! And yet it is my doing, and the guilt weighs heavily upon my every moment.'",

Can you know my story and say it is not so?\\n\\n'Amroth was a king among Elves, but to me he was more; he was my love, and the brightest star of my night sky. \\qWe must depart, Nimrodel,\\q he said to me, \\qfor the dwarves have awoken terrible evil, and if we stay it will endanger our folk too,\\q and I believed his words. I believe them still, for I know what befell in the centuries since, as he cannot.\\n\\n'Amroth went ahead to make ready the ship. I travelled with a small company to join him at that distant harbour, but the passage of the mountains was hard. The high crags filled me with unease; the rocky way troubled my heart. When at last we descended to the low-lands, I danced in the woods and became separated from my folk, so grateful was I to leave the mountains behind. The sound of the River Gilrain was beautiful, and its music had magic in it, and whatever else befell I can still remember how it was, and know that I loved it. I slept in peace for too long, and by the time I awoke a fell wind had come from the north and driven my love's ship from the shore, never to return. It is said Amroth leapt from the ship and braved the waves that he might wait for me... but never again was he seen by Elf or by Man, though I walked the shore for uncounted days and innumerable nights.\\n\\n'I dwelled in sorrow from that day forth, never far from the Bay where I lost my love, and I have worn this mourning veil for so long I cannot remember the sight of the sun without it. I have held my grief close, but so too has it held me. Until now I believed the weight of those heavy chains was only mine to carry. I did not know you sorrowed too, Maiden of the Gilrain. It was not for you to feel this way. Do not burden yourself with the grief that is mine. I spoke of cruelty? The greatest cruelty is that this sadness must snare more than one heart, and for so many years!'",
