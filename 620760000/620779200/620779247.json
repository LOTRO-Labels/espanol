I need some assistance tracking down some of the ingredients for my famous snapper-soup.\\n\\n'My soup is made with the meat of the snapper-turtle that lives in the lake to the east of Hengstacer. I usually send one of the hands to fetch me the meat, but they have been so busy, I would feel awful making them hunt down their dinner however slow it may be. I could also use  more snapper-shells to make soup-bowls. Better not to waste anything, I always say.\\n\\n'Hurry along now and fetch the snapper-shells and meat... the farmhands get awful hungry after a hard day of tending the horses, and I would hate to make them wait.'",
