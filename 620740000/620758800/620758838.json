This writ granted the Fallohide brothers, Marcho and Blanco, the lands that became the Shire. It is a most exceptional find! True, I already have a copy of the document, but it is in very poor shape. If this copy is in better condition, it would be a marvelous addition to the Mathom-house!\\n\\n'Would you go to Tookland and speak to Adelard about this find? I believe you can find him in the Great Smials in Tuckborough.'",
