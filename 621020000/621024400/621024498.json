I have much unfinished business to manage here, and I would appreciate the help of a skilled and trusted friend such as you.\\n\\n'When we last left the tower of Cirith Ungol, it was besieged by spiders; if the Gúrzyul failed to reinforce the garrison, the tower might fall to the spiders, and that would unleash the spiders upon Gorgoroth, and perhaps the larger world! I have heard no reports of spider activity beyond Lhingris, so perhaps the Orcs prevailed. We will have to investigate.\\n\\n'There is also the matter of the Mirkwood spiders. When my father faced our old enemy Iphantamel, she said that all of her daughters had left her. We suspect that they may have come here, at the call of their true mother.\\n\\n'Finally, we must discover if Ungwetári yet lives. As valiant as Master Samwise is, I do not believe she would have succumbed to such a small wound, though it was inflicted by a courageous heart. She is ancient and powerful.\\n\\n'There is much to do. We should begin by questioning the Rangers of Ithilien.

Specifically, where the spider presence is, their numbers, and if the Orcs have any forces here. Indeed, despite Shelob's apparent defeat, we have already established that the spiders linger still. As of yet, we have found no evidence of Shelob herself, living or dead, but have found many of her brood.\\n\\n'We know not the situation in the tower. I sent some Rangers to approach as close as they could to it, which is not especially close, for the path is treacherous and spider-infested. They reported they could detect little Orc activity on this side of the tower. I do not know if they have simply moved the garrison closer to Dor Amarth, or if they have abandoned the tower entirely.\\n\\n'We also noticed when we set up camp here that someone, likely an uruk based on the size of the prints, had passed this way very recently, heading east toward the tower. Mírthel and Gladhir may have more information for you.'",
