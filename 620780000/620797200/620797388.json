Mostly, they descend through the passages to the east to fall upon the smaller and more weakly defended settlements of Men which border the Mirkwood, but on occasion, when their strength grows, they have been known to raid Elf-settlements on the edges of Rivendell's domain -- though these over-bold assaults generally turn out badly for the goblins, and few return.",
