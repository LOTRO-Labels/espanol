We have not the power to bring down those walls -- not as long as the Eye of Sauron is turned towards Lothlórien -- and soon Mirkwood will be overrun with Enemy reinforcements.\\n\\n'We are here to draw the enemy's ire and to inflict as grievous a wound as we may before we are driven back across the Anduin. The Orcs of Dol Guldur will eventually fall upon the Golden Wood, but we can and will delay that day.\\n\\n'Thus our true goal here is to destroy as much of the garrison of Gathbúrz as possible before then: soldiers, supplies, leadership...whatever we can lay to ruin before we are forced to retreat. Every Orc you slay here is one less to ford the Anduin when they come against Lothlórien in the coming days.'",
