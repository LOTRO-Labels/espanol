Perhaps I am rather too lenient with the whims of my good people, for I gave Nífdir leave to investigate the whisperings, and now it has been many days since his return.\\n\\n'The whisperings, yes. Have you not heard them? We all perceived the shudderings and discontent amongst the trees as we travelled through the drowned lands. Good Nífdir wished to remain and hear them, for he is more concerned with the trees than with the Orcs and wraiths. He loves all forests, however bleak and black they seem. I had not the heart to forbid him.\\n\\n'Did I do wrong to leave him behind? It has been many days since we parted ways to the west of here, in the heart of the swamp. I yearn to know if he has come to harm, but I do not wish to send others into danger for my foolishness, for we are precious few, and our mission is clear. I have already compromised our plans.
