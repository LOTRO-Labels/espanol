Until recently, our trade has been brisk, but darkness has come to these lands and our people, the Eglain, face starvation and deal with murder.\\n\\n'Goblins have crept into the Lone-lands and have made trade difficult; they attacked us, murdering many of our number and seized many of our trade-goods. Ruins of ancient Arnor overlook a large valley to the south-east of The Forsaken Inn. Minas Eriol, that place is called, and it was long dear to my people. Would you go there and retrieve our trade-bundles from the crates that remain and return to me?\\n\\n'The crates are all that remain of our last collection.'",

There was peace, and we did not think to fear for it. But then... a Ranger and some others crossed the Last Bridge into the Trollshaws, and evil has spread in their wake.\\n\\n'From the north came goblins and dwarves in league with Orcs -- unheard of, but true. From the south, Orcs bearing a symbol of a White Hand spread into Annunlos. All of these foes ravaged the land and drove us from the ruins where we once lived in peace.'",
