I have seen my brother fall to madness, the deaths of my sons, and great beasts of terror marching upon Minas Tirith. What sickness of the mind takes hold that would conjure such foul thoughts? I know not if any of these shall come to pass, but I must work to prevent them if I might. Lord Angbor has his own path to forge into the East, but I would ask something else of you. \\n\\n'You may be the last to heed my words... so I beg you to travel to Arnach and speak to a warrior called Baranor. It may delay you, and it may even change your course, but I cannot let those that I love fall to such horrors.'",
