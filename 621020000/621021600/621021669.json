With the help of the Woodmen, my men have uncovered a new way down into the old warrens to the south. My men claim that many of the passages are still unexplored, but they will not remain so for long. I have given you and your men more than enough time at the old dredging site. If you do not find anything worthwhile within two days' time, you are ordered to report to the warrens of Tun Melen. Do not disappoint me.\\n\\nS",
