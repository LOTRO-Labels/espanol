I will not make that mistake. Together our enemies will fall before us, and we will sit upon twin thrones and rule Mordor forever. We will marry, and let that be a union to make our enemies quake!\\n\\nBut to thy second suggestion... I must decline. Seregost is not a suitable location. May I suggest the bones of Barad-dûr instead? That would be a place most fitting for we two to ascend to the rule of Mordor.\\n\\nDulgabêth, Lord of Mordor and Heir of Sauron",
