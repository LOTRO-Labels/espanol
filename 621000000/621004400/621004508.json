Yes, this request is my own!\\n\\n'You see, a number of former prisoners have been freed from the yoke of slavery in Gorgoroth, and now they seek to make homes for themselves in Gondor. Many of these freed slaves are Nurnhoth, the people of Nurn, to the south. I have not studied their family trees as sufficiently as I would like, for while I am a student of lineage and ancestry, my specialty is in that of the larger hobbit families of the Shire. Still, I understand that the Nurnhoth are of Easterling descent, and have Easterling customs and habits.\\n\\n'This is a long way of saying that many of the freed Nurnhoth have different tastes than the rest of us, and while they have freedom they still lack some of the things that would make them most comfortable. I speak of food, [placeholder]! I have conversed with some of them, and have learned that they would enjoy a few traditional meals: Khingal, Lavang, and Pishi Badam, which they have described to me but I have never sampled. We do not have the ingredients for these meals, but we might take them from some of the Easterlings in Gorgoroth who are hostile to us. Deprive the Easterlings at Rhûd Vorn, on the eastern side of the vale of Udûn, of their food jars, and I may be able to cook up some of these meals for the freed Nurnhoth. I want them to feel welcome, [placeholder], and this may help them feel more at home!'",
