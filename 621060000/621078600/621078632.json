I feared you dead, but I am glad to have been proven wrong.\\n\\n'I returned home safe some weeks ago, and have been dealing with a frustration ever since. I don't know if you are aware that the Ringl√≥ Vale produces much of the timber used in Gondor. Yet I arrived home only to find that the nearby lumber camp has been laying idle! I tried to speak to the owner of the camp, a surly man named Dravron, but he's only offered middling excuses. I could step in as acting Lord of the Vale, but I am loath to wield my power so heavy handedly, at least not yet.\\n\\n'Say, you are a fine conversationalist. Perhaps he would be more open with you than he would me. Find the camp up the hill, north-east from Ethring. See if he'll tell you why he's dragging his feet up there!'",
