He must be defeated at all cost, but I cannot send one such as yourself alone to face him. His power is too great.\\n\\n'There are only three within this vale strong enough to oppose a Gaunt-lord, and neither Gandalf nor I may leave at this time. Therefore, I bid you speak with Glorfindel and let him know what we have learned. I have no doubt that he will accompany you against this evil.'",
