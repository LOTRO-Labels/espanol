Boring onions just won't do for me.\\n\\nApple:\\nNot just any apple -- something that will offer a bit of contrast to the onion you fetched me.\\n\\nBread:\\nSweet, fluffy, light bread. Crusty on the outside, like a cloud on the inside. That's what I want.\\n\\nCabbage:\\nBut I don't like cabbage very much, so a small quantity will suffice.\\n\\nMeat:\\nI certainly need some meat, but I'd like something substantial. Salty, but not too salty. Fatty, but not too fatty. A delicious chop, perhaps? A steak? Oh, you decide.\\n\\nCheese, wonderful cheese:\\nI have a hankering for something soft and delicate with a sweet flavour.",
