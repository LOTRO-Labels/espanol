There is an altar in the crumbling cellar of one of the ruins to the south-east...but I also found out what power is behind it. There is a Cargûl -- one of the cursed knights of Eärnur -- hiding somewhere in those ruins! I have heard his name whispered by his servants. He is known as Mâb Rhûnadan. \\n\\n'I consulted Agorin on the matter. It seems that this creature is a favoured apprentice to one of the Nine, and a powerful sorcerer in his own right. Be very careful should you encounter him!\\n\\n'If you can make your way to the altar and destroy it, that should put an end to their power here for the time being -- barring that, you may have to destroy the Cargûl himself. I also doubt he will allow you to interfere with his place of power unmolested.'",
