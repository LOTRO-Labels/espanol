Taken together, these symbols and signs, understood only by the forge-workers of this place, convey a message.\\n\\n'For instance, a half-circle might be taken to mean dawn, or perhaps dusk, and three close lines might be taken for a meeting. A raised arm might be taken for taskmaster and one bent like a snake might be water - or drink. In truth, I know not.\\n\\n'If you will go and make a study of these banners, however, I feel certain that together we may get to the root of it and so discover what plans the lurking dwellers of this place are making behind our backs. It is sure to be something treacherous and harmful to Gondor!'",
