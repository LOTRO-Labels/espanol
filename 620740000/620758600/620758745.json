But peace will not come to us, not while the enemy follows us south. We stay here now, away from the forest and bog, ever in the sun to shield ourselves from darkness. At night, the trolls will roam free.\\n\\n'If we could confront the darkness and defeat it, we could, perhaps, make friends of others who wish not to succumb to the shadow of evil. You have helped the tribe who wishes our friendship... perhaps you would help the Jorthkyn, too?\\n\\n'Would you fight the trolls for us, make them go away? They hide in the bog, far to the south and east of here, at a place that Elf-folk call Harloeg. You are very tiny... but you should be fine on your own.'",
