      "en": "After Elendil escaped the Downfall of Númenor, he asked leave of Gil-galad to settle many of the surviving Númenóreans near Arassien, for he had spent many glad days there in the Elf-king’s company on his voyages across the Sea. Gil-galad granted this request gladly, and Elendil founded the North-kingdom of Arnor on the shores of Lake Nenuial to the north. Arassien became a part of the king’s province of Arthedain, but Elendil deemed that the Men of Westernesse should build no towns or cities there, and left it as pristine woodland so Men and Elves could share in the pleasures of the hunt together, and, indeed, he and Gil-galad, and the lords and ladies of their courts, roamed there often in one another’s company. Only one hall did Elendil allow to be built there: Bâr Faroth, the Hunters’ House, where he spent many pleasant months over the following century, until Sauron’s invasion of the South-kingdom of Gondor led to the War of the Great Alliance.\\n\\nThere are fewer Men and Elves in this land today, but the memory of their hunts together persists, and the woodlands of Yondershire remain full of antlered game, the descendants of those clever and lucky enough to live and thrive on the Kings' Hunting Ground.",
