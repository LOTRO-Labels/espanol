They had bought some old dwarf-made prospector's map of the Gorge...it must have been twenty-years-old or more, if it was not fraudulent.\\n\\n'They wanted to head down into the Gorge and investigate the old prospecting sites. We told them not to waste their time, but I guess they had already spent much coin on that fool's map, so they insisted on heading down all the same.\\n\\n'For the first week or so, they got on all right -- set up some sort of camp, made a few runs into town for supplies -- but we have heard nothing recently. It has been a while, and I do not have high hope that you will find them alive, but if you can find out what happened to them, it would take some weight off my mind.'",
