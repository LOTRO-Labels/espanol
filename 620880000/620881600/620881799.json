Any transaction of noticeable size must go through his auction, and he happily takes a price from each lot.\\n\\n'I need some time to take inventory and get everything cleaned and ready for sale. While I do that, you go talk with Bedwur and secure a position in the upcoming auction. You can find him near the centre of town by the auction-platform.'",
