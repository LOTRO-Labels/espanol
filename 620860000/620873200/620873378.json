The mayor has been in no position to do us any harm again, and we are all much better off... and happy and healthy. No one is left without a home or without bread and meat for supper.\\n\\nAt the time, I could not thank you properly, but my wife and I have come into some money, and we wanted to spend some of it on you. Your goodness will never leave our thoughts!\\n\\nI have mailed your gift to a friend in Bree, who will be happy to give it to you. You need only pick it up, and it is yours.\\n\\nSincerely,\\nDaley Utteridge of Winter-home",
