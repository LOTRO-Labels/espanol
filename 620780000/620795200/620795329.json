Brought two chickens to share with L, but his spirits were low, and I think the food brought him no joy. Understandable, of course. Keeping N within the walls of Sithad must be a great sorrow to him.\\n\\n<rgb=#002020>(The next several pages are illegible, and some leaves are torn and missing.)</rgb>\\n\\nL told me today of my predecessors -- the long lives of Elves are a wonder to me, and he spoke with distressing honesty of his reason for choosing N's keepers from among my kind, and not of the Eldar. His own people would disapprove, but more than that he desired no one caretaker to be so near to N for so long. The short lives of Men better-suited his purposes.

I will carry out his wishes by breaking the keys to Sithad (the stones of TÃ¢l Bruinen are heavy and will serve) and hiding them. I will not tell the Elf where they lie, but I record it here if there be need. To hide it from the eyes of....\\n<rgb=#002020>(Several lines are smudged and missing.)</rgb>\\n\\n...must stand at the stairs of Sithad, looking up towards the entrance. Turn to the left and walk forward to the wall, and then turn right and follow the curve until you see four pillars through two pillars. Walk between the two and look to the right of the four. I will leave the keys always in the shade.\\n\\nL fears for me, but I will be fine. I am not called Oakheart for naught, and he tells me I guarded N for longer than any other. I have nothing to fear.\\n\\n<rgb=#002020>(The rest of the diary is blank.)</rgb>",
