I saw it in the Pool of the King only weeks after my daughter Nona departed, following the dream that carried her away to fight another kingdom's war. She returned months afterward with a broken heart and a child in her belly, and I thought you would return in the company of this man, this Horn who was the father of the child. But sun and moon rose and fell, and it was not you who first came to Lhanuch with tidings.'\\n\\nSuvulch frowns, and you remember that he considers himself more gifted with weapons than with words.\\n\\n'It was a minstrel, an old one with white hair and a solemn face. He said he served a king of the horse-lords who perished fighting the Dark Lord, and he had sad tidings for Nona. \\qHorn is dead,\\q he said to her, and while she had raged with anger in the wordless months that passed, her fury was replaced all at once, and with sorrow. I wept with the two of them. Yes, even I! But I am her father, and I raised my Nona to be strong. Her tears showed to me how deeply she loved this Horn, even though she buried that love beneath the rage she held for him, and which he deserved! So I wept alongside them, and when the minstrel departed I embraced my daughter and I told her that I would never again say a cross word about the man Horn.\\n\\n'I meant it even then, but in time I have come to understand he was a man of courage who believed he was not courageous, [placeholder]. That is a curious thing, and not common among the Uch-lûth. But perhaps not all can be as honest as Suvulch, who is certain of his courage and acts upon it every day.'\\n\\nHe roughly clasps your arm, and then points up the hill.\\n\\n'My daughter sits by the summit of the village, by the fire on the right. She will be glad to see you.'",

When the days feel longest I wonder if Hildegard would tell me whether I am having a son or a daughter... but I cannot bring myself to return to the soothsayer's cave. When Gléowine came to Lhanuch and told me of what transpired before the walls of Minas Tirith... it was as if I was hearing of it for the second time, seeing it again, feeling anew all the pain of it. So I will not return to Hildegard.\\n\\n'Gléowine spoke also of your deeds, and I know Horn was avenged. I would have become Wadu's Ghost once more and done it myself, but you can see that I am somewhat occupied for now. So I thank you, and I know Horn does as well, and so does his child.'",
