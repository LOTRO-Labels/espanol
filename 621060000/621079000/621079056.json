I think they are sure to agree to join the crew, given their friendship with King Elessar and their loyalty to Queen Arwen, their sister, but I do not know if they have ever travelled to Umbar. Their skills with bow and knife may be most valuable, if such becomes necessary.\\n\\nI understand they remained in Pinnath Gelin when we returned to Lond Cirion, but someone at Ost Arnd√≠r will know where they may be found.",
