The tomes within have no value in coin but are priceless in the hearts of the Rohirrim. We had tried to keep the library in good repair, but as the forces of the Enemy grew we were forced to abandon it. It has since been occupied by foul Easterlings, seeking anything they can find in order to gain any advantage over us.'",
