Gorgar and Dushtalbúk are but pawns to the Dragon, and now fully under her control! If anything, the Orcs and hobgoblins are even more dangerous now, for they work in unison rather than tearing at each others' throats. However, our campaign in Gundabad has had no small effect, and I suspect Hrímil will now pull back her forces to protect her lair. For all her haughtiness, she must be feeling rather cornered.\\n\\n'The unknown factor in all of this is Loknashra. Hrímil was unable to control her, due to whatever dark magic the Angmarim instilled in her, and she spoke of revenge. I have a feeling she will soon make some move, and we must be ready for it... whatever form it takes.\\n\\n'But enough of doom and gloom! We will face those foes another day.
