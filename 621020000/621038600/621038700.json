Blasted waggon snatchers made off with my pony and my waggon full of supplies! Thankfully, these good folk found me wandering on the road and brought me here. Grateful though I am, the League of the Axe hasn't any time to go chasing after a silly hobbit’s supplies. If… if you could help me with this task, I could make it worth your while!\\n\\n'The brigands went up into the Wildwood with Stomper and my supply waggon. You shoulda seen how Stomper fought them! He wasn’t going without a fight, and my supplies went flying everywhere! I bet if you follow the trail of bags that were tossed, it would lead you straight to Stomper! If you happen upon any of those brigands or their leader on the way, I encourage you to deal with them swiftly!'",
