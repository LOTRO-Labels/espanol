Grown to almost adult size, though still just a young boy, it is said that Fram slew many Orcs and even a mighty hill-troll, though I am certain his deeds might have been exaggerated over the years. Perhaps we should find and slay some hill-trolls for Skarding? It would also put to rest the notion that one as young as Fram could stand toe to toe with such a beast!'",
