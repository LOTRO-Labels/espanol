I can see no foes, but a great feeling of dread hangs upon me and I cannot breathe but with a great effort. I reach for Lanchigil, but he is gone; with my other hand I grasp Egnassigil, but it is too late! I am falling, falling, falling from the stairway, and before waking I hear a voice call out from a high place, 'It grieves me that they will no longer strike fear into the hearts of her foes.'\\n\\n'And then I awaken, but the memory of the dream will not leave me, and its dread remains.'",
