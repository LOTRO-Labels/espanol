Is it always like this?\\n\\nOur cousin Varthmath sent me a letter requesting my aid on his own journey, but I think I will respectfully decline. Instead, perhaps you will help him with his task?\\n\\nHe has gone below the mountains to the dwarf-land of Moria. I am not setting foot down there! But perhaps you will find it more to your liking? He wrote that he would be at a place called Orc-watch among the Redhorn Lodes. Help him if you like! I will stay here, where I can dream of adventure without experiencing all that walking!\\n\\nSterkist",
