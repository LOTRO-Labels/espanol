How am I to deliver seven such valuable stones to Prince Durin? Each of the Zabad'ibîn should be carefully-handled, and I should fear to drop one when the time comes to pass them into the prince's hands....\\n\\n'Ah-ha! A solution comes. I will not deliver the stones into Durin's care individually, but rather fashioned into a larger work of art! But what? Perhaps a statue of the prince himself, holding aloft one or more of the gems? Mayhap the statue can wear a belt with the seven stones embedded within? Worry not! These problems can be solved.\\n\\n'There is the small matter of finding the Zabad'ibîn.
