I need to check in with our local Bounders, so while I do that, go on ahead and get some Yonderboar meat and some apples. You can pick up some fallen apples near the trees around the big farm in Tighfield. Yonderboar also like the fallen apples, so they might be near the farm too! Bring the meat and apples to Finola Whortleberry and then meet me up the road with pie in hand.'",
