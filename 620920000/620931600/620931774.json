      "en": "The royal Riding of the Mark is among the most fertile and pleasant regions of Rohan. Green grasslands with scattered farms and crofts can be found between the rivers Snowbourn and Swiftwater. At its southern end, along the White Mountains, woods of oak and pine cover the hills.\\n\\nOn a large hill stands Edoras, the greatest city of the Eorlingas, where reigns Th√©oden, son of Thengel, from the Golden Hall of Meduseld. Before the city itself stretch the Barrowfields, where sleep the Kings of Rohan in death.\\n\\nBehind Edoras, the valley of Harrowdale follows the Snowbourn deep into the White Mountains. A winding trail leads into the heights, arriving eventually at the high plateau of Dunharrow. Beyond the dark wood of Dimholt lies the Dark Door, but the paths beyond are no longer travelled by mortal men.",
