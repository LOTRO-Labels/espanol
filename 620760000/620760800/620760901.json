Many of the herbs I am seeking have become hard to find in these lands.\\n\\n'Periwinkle can be found growing from rock outcroppings in the hills of Nan Amlug to the north, near the dwarf-mines of Othrikar. Meadowsweet is found here in the Kingsfell growing at the base of trees on the southern side. I have picked almost all in this area, but I know of some plants in the spider-lair south of Esteldín. Butterbur can be found in Meluinen, not far from the Elf-refuge of Lin Giliath, growing along the water's edge.\\n\\n'These herbs are useful in treating many ailments and injuries, and my kin are certain to suffer more than their share in the coming days.'",
