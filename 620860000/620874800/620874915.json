However, if done correctly, one can trick them into believing something much larger is going on around them and scare them into a panic.\\n\\n'That is what we will do to the goblins at Tham Andalath. We can defeat as many as we want, but goblins are thicker than the flies at night, and will only return. We must make them not want to.\\n\\n'The flames at Tham Andalath are the key. Night and day they are constantly burning, the goblins never let them go out. They must fear the darkness and believe something out there will get them if the fires are not lit. If you were to put them out, I believe the goblins may leave all on their own.'",
