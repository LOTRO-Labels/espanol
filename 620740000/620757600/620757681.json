The tweens came to see me, upset by the lack of effort the Bounders are doing here in Buckland with regard to the strange Big Folk moving about.\\n\\n'I told them the Bounders were doing all they could to keep that unsavoury lot out of Buckland, but the pair were adamant about being heard and kept yammering on about the Old Forest. I warned them to stay clear of the forest because Toly, our wood-cutter, said that things there are queerer than ever.\\n\\n'Tweens can be foolish, and I fear that the pair have been more foolish than normal. Doderic knows his way to Bald Hill and not much further. If you're going to be looking for Rollo, you'd best start with Doderic, and you might as well tell him that I'm waiting for him, too!'",
