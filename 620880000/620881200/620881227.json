I don't know exactly what evil they've cooked up this time, or how they did it, but these goblins are using some kind of strange black powder to aid their mining. When it catches fire, the stuff explodes, shattering rock into rubble -- and you, too, if you are standing too close.\\n\\n'They store the powder in barrels, which I've seen mostly near the smelters. If you can sneak up and set fire to those barrels, you will likely catch the lot of them in the blast.'",
