Unless a greater power than any we possess intervenes, they will be there in the end. You might defeat them for a moment, serving to weaken the forms they wear, but over time they will grow in strength and ferocity. If Gorothúl has somehow lit a beacon for these beings, that they may find their way back to these halls, then it is already too late. There can be no lasting victory against them for so long as Gorothúl's mark lasts.'",
