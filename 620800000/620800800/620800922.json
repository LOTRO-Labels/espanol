I couldn't have done it without you!\\n\\n'In the meantime, please let me introduce you to my friend, Gredlan Mugwort. He has come up with a wonderful plan. He thinks that if we work together, we can create bouquets and gifts for suitors to give their sweethearts.\\n\\n'We would appreciate it if you would go out and pick more of those lovely flowers; you can come back and trade them in to Gredlan in exchange for a wonderful present. We look forward to seeing what flowers you bring back! You can pick all the blooms from flower patches around the areas where you found the flowers I asked for. Violets are found most often in Bree-land, primroses in Ered Luin, and marigolds in the Shire.\\n\\n'Do not worry if you feel as if you do not have enough time to find all the flowers you need today.  You can always come back tomorrow and try again!'",
