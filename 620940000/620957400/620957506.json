If you have a moment, I have grave news.\\n\\n'We Gondorians from Dol Amroth have known of the threat in Tarlang's Crown, but only recently have we started to seeing their forces East of the Crown. I fear they may be attempting to capture more than just the lands West of here. The worse part of this news is the abominations under their command. These are twisted creatures, using dark Umbarrim magic. Azruthor's forces must be stopped!'",
