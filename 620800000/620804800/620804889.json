Though I have never been there, one of my cousins, Leithólf, recently led a group of my people up to Forochel to seek their fortunes trading with the Lossoth.\\n\\n'If you were to travel to those lands, I would ask you to seek out Leithólf and ensure that he is safe. I have not heard from him in many months, though that is his way, coming and going for long stretches of time without correspondence to his kin.\\n\\n'He said that he would be taking his caravan to Kauppa-kohta. A strange sounding name for a town, isn't it? He said it lay north of the land of Evendim through Cirith Rhiw, the Gate to the North.'",
