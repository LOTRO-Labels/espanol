It cannot be avoided. Better to accept the road and set our affairs in order than to fight it fruitlessly. In fewer than three hours it will be the fourteenth of March. We are unlikely to live until dawn on the fifteenth!'\\n\\nYou shake your head to clear it, but still your mind is foggy. Is it really only half past nine in the evening of the thirteenth of March? The account seemed so vivid, so real...\\n\\nYour eyes turn toward the palant√≠r. Denethor laughs, but there is no humour in it.\\n\\n'I have wrestled with the seeing-stone for many days, [placeholder]. I am not surprised that the experience left you feeling unwell, and particularly susceptible to the words I spoke. Can you not see how the tale I spun you must surely follow from the images you beheld in the stone? The end has come. The end has come! The armies have not yet surrounded Minas Tirith, but they will. The folk have not yet thrown in with the Withered Tree, but they will! Grond has not yet come to the gates, but it will! How long can they stand against that ram? If they last even a minute longer than I believe, that will be a triumph. But it will not matter. All that I have told you will come to pass.'\\n\\nYou try to tell the Steward that he is wrong, but you cannot find the words.\\n\\n'You have seen what I saw in the stone. Hirgon and the Red Arrow did not make it to Rohan, and the foolish one Mithrandir sent to Mordor is a captive in Cirith Ungol! Yes, I know of that errand. And I know it has failed! Whatever that fool brought with him is now gone, and if it is the weapon I perceive, it will not matter if the gates of Minas Tirith last five minutes or five hours. The end will come! It has already come!\\n\\n'Go, [placeholder]! Go and die! Every person in this city will follow you soon!'",
