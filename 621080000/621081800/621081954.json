For more than twenty-five years I lived on that ship, raiding and pillaging, living the life of a Corsair, a brigand of the waves.

He encouraged me not to sail with Balakhôr, one of the Heirs of Castamir, and in that way he saved my life, for all who followed Balakhôr to Gondor perished in the war. Ever since that day I have supported the Kindred of the Coins. Loyalty to any others, and the life of a Corsair, are both behind me now.\\n\\n'I ask you to understand, stranger. I lived a criminal's life, yes, but it was the only life I had available to me. Tumúldo understood that, and so did Khâsha, and now I dedicate my life to serving each of them.
