Events unfolded differently than we thought they would, but I could not let the mission end in failure because of my own selfishness. Raddir did not have the choice I did, nor did Sigileth. Only Achardor seems to have understood what I came to know: that I would have closed my eyes forever if it meant the death and loss that happened to that point would have had a reason; that it would have mattered.\\n\\n'Still, I am grateful for the actions of Bróin. I have picked a beautiful flower from the slopes of Cerin Amroth. Will you bring it to him in Moria, with my good wishes and my thankfulness?
