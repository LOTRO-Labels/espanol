She surveys the entire field of battle and sets up all the pieces to her liking.\\n\\nLearn to lay down traps in just the right spot before the battle begins. When your enemy closes the distance between you, he will be in for a big surprise.\\n\\nBecome comfortable with melee weapons. In a perfect world, you could just sit back in relative safety and kill from afar for the rest of your days. All too often, though, the enemy will close distance and turn things into a brawl. Stay calm. Your dual-wielding style gives you plenty of tools to harass, hinder, and dfeat your foe.\\n\\nOn a final note, keep focus in mind as you press on in the hunt. Some of your abilities generate focus while others deplete it. Maintaining a high degree of focus will allow you to make your most vicious attacks count. Good hunting.\\n\\n-T.",
