The tomb-robbers we drove from Rantost fled to the south and are now threatening our hold within the Way of Kings. The Way of Kings is where the ancient rulers of my people are buried. Those that watched over Ann√∫minas and Evendim from on high now sleep below. Their memories are to be cherished and thought of often, but their tombs are not to be disturbed.\\n\\n'I have also heard rumours and whispers of another force amongst the ruins. I believe you have encountered them already within the estates to the east of here. I fear we have little time to determine their motives and defeat them before it will be too late.\\n\\n'Head south to the Way of Kings and meet up with Nimbellas at his camp and see what you can do to help.'",
