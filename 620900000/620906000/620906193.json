A resting place for those who have fallen in the battles before, we go there to remember their sacrifice and rejoice in their deeds. It pains me greatly that with the Eastemnet ablaze we have not been able to keep it in the state of cleanliness our ancestors deserve. While we must battle and fight for our future we cannot dishonour our past.'",
