I deem he is made of stern material, as are all the Elves of my acquaintance. Yes, I now include the Kintai among that number, for if Ulishár is representative of that folk they seem as resilient as any of the Eldar!\\n\\n'Find him at TBD and judge his resolve in this for yourself.'",

He never lost the adventuring temperament as I did; he hungered still for the untaken road, ever desiring to see what lay beyond the furthest rise and over the horizon. I shared that mood with him, once...'\\n\\nThe Kinta tries to meet your eyes again but cannot. Instead he stares away into the trees.\\n\\n'Some years ago I was captured by the Ordâkhai while travelling in the Mûr. Held in their distant city of Emax Dûl and put to harsh labour, I was certain I would die there. I still cannot believe I did not. Instead, with no small degree of fortunate happenstance I escaped from Emax Dûl and made my way home.\\n\\n'This was mere months ago, [placeholder]. I promised myself I would stray no longer from Sul Madásh... but now Baharúd is slain, and the Wizard Inkanûsh says a threat more terrifying than Ordâkh has risen. How can I remain in Sul Madásh when I know you and your companions need my help? I simply cannot.'",
