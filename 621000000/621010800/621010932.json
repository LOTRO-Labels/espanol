The loss of Bótuz Frostblood must be a grievous injury to them, and I confess that it pains me also. Would Bótuz and the others who died during Karazgar's attack still be alive if I had not lowered my weapon in the Ironfold? Would they still live if I had kept them from crossing the Dale-lands? Ah, I will not dwell upon it. What was done is done, and might have been worse.\\n\\n'It is good to hear that Inek will take up the mantle of leadership and ready his people for another attack. Karazgar promised to come to Skarháld three times? How much worse will be the following assaults, if this was merely the first? It bodes ill, [placeholder].\\n\\n'I know the Zhélruka do not care for me. Nay, do not seek to deny it! It is true. I am unproven. Did I count myself ready when we battled the Easterlings outside Utterby back in the Ironfold? That counted for naught, or less than naught! To do battle against Karazgar, in defence not only of my people but of another... that is where my true glory lies. We will stand with Inek and his Zhélruka to repel whatever Karazgar sends against us, and perhaps afterward I will feel my name deserved. It will be my honour to stand with them and with you, [placeholder]. There is much we must do if we are to be ready. The first promise is fulfilled. When the next comes, we must be ready. We have no choice.'",
