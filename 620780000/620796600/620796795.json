You seem a bit of an adventurous sort... perhaps you wouldn't mind helping out an old hobbit?\\n\\n'You see, I have been writing a book about my travels with Thorin and his Company -- off to deal with Smaug and get Thorin's gold back -- and I am afraid I may have gotten confused on some details. My memory isn't what it used to be, and I am unsure of the directions to some of the places we visited.\\n\\n'Perhaps you would help me? All you need to do is find the Back Door of Goblin-town... if you find the place, I have remembered them a-right. High in the mountains, along the stretch called the High Pass, we travelled and at night found a dry place in a cave midway up the mountain. You should find the entrance there. If not, well, try and find the correct directions for me, if you would be so kind.'",
