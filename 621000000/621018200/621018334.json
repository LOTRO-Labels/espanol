I heard a curious tale from one of the patrons of Winter-home. Have you heard it as well?\\n\\n'No? Well, it goes that there was once a greedy, old giant named Storvâgûn who lived above Helegrod. He was so greedy that he decided to speak for all of his friends and make a deal with some nasty Men from the North. Even worse, all his friends went along with it - except for one! That one, Arifael, was a better sort of giant... a friendly giant! So Arifael found some new friends and sent them to stop old Storvâgûn from being so selfish! And then they took all of his treasure!\\n\\n'You know, saying that out loud... I think I have forgotten the lesson of the tale. But I am certain there is one!\\n\\n'Anyway, rumour has it that old Storvâgûn returns to count his riches atop Helegrod during the Yule Festival. I'm not sure I believe it, but if it were true, I bet a brave adventurer like you could snatch a few coins out from under his nose!\\n\\n'I'd make it worth your while, but if you go looking for his gold, don't blame me if you find him too!'",
