There was cruelty in the Sea-shadow, as there was cruelty in all of us... but I believed it was needed against the evils arrayed against us. The Church of the All-Seeing, the Empire of Ordakh... these were foes against which we could show no mercy. The hatred I bore for Gondor...\\n\\n'Aye, I would not show mercy to any warriors of Gondor who opposed us. But not children. The boy Thorongil was not yet a man, and Azagath would have drenched the stones of the Citadel with his blood. Nakási would have obeyed the command, and done whatever the Sea-shadow ordered. The writing was there, but even then I followed the two of them as they fled. In the Depths of Mâkhda Khorbo my crew paid for my inaction, my indecision. Azagath slew them with dark, unnatural magic, and their sacrifice meant nothing.\\n\\n'Do you have a crew of your own, stranger? Do you know what it means to lose them all, and for nothing?'",

They saved us from the rule of the Empire of Ordakh and the Church of the All-Seeing, after all. Let me just say this, friend.

May justice come swiftly for the ones responsible!\\n\\n'I heard there was fell magic involved. It is said a great beast with five heads emerged from a column of water and shook the Citadel to its very foundation, but that is not the most surprising thing I have heard! I heard each of the five heads bore a woman's countenance, and the beauty of each was matched only by her ferocity.\\n\\n'Yes, it is preposterous, but this is a land where surprising things can happen! I was not there, and neither were you. I believe this beast lives, unless Azagath has already slain it. If you were a resident of this city you would know he is capable of great martial feats.

But they also promised to heed the will of the people and hear their concerns, but the Meeting-hall of Dâr Laja remains shut. Where once I saw Azagath and the other leaders of the Kindred walking through the city, that has happened less and less often of late. Where are Tatháta and her mighty hounds? Where are Tumúldo and his wife Nakási? The only leader of the Kindred I see with any regularity is the dwarf Khôltekh, and I do not like the look in his eye. He is plotting something within the Shoreward Stone, you mark my words.\\n\\n'But for my part I believe the Kindred has our best interests in mind.
