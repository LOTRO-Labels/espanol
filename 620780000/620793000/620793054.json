The sound of a minstrel's instrument can usually be heard throughout Bree, though it is becoming rarer by the day.\\n\\n'You see, the usual fair for the woodworkers of Bree besides hunting bows and farmcraft was wooden instruments. Clarinets, harps, and viols...ah, the beautiful viols! Those are one of the harder instruments that our woodworkers craft here in Bree. Well, what with all the commotion with the brigands hereabouts, the woodworkers have been hard-pressed by the demand for all manner of spears, bows, and staves, and they haven't the time to craft new viols!\\n\\n'If you would, find five viol and return them here to me.
