The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.\\n\\nLore of the Blade seems to be a rather unusual tome for a Lore-master to express interest in. Rather than delving deeply into the hidden mysteries of mountains, or discussing at length the habits of wave and wind, it reads more like a rousing tale of adventure written to entertain hobbit-children. The pages of Lore of the Blade claim to follow the adventures of a brave young Lore-master who when confronted with deadly dangers is just as apt to fight her way through with flashing sword-play as to confound her opponents with the lore of the elements or the wisdom of long forgotten sages. Oddly, as you find yourself drawn into the stirring tale you begin to see the more subtle nuances of the story unfold through the eyes of its character, who displays an uncanny insight into the nature of the foes she faces, and an understanding of when the strength of arms applied at the correct moment may indeed be the least destructive course.\\n\\nUnfortunately, some prior reader has handled this copy rather poorly and some of the pages are torn beyond repair. The author also proves to be a bit difficult to pin down, as he has chosen to identify himself solely by the runic letter 'G' inscribed on the binding.",

Yes well, no point denying it. I wrote that book some many years ago -- as I recall, it was for some lord or other who had done me a great service. He was a doting parent, and his children so enjoyed my tales when I dropped by to visit that he begged me to write a few of them down so he could read to them when I wasn't about. I foolishly agreed to his request, and the next thing I know the cursed fool had gone and had his scribes churn out copies for the entire nobility of the realm!\\n\\n'I was the laughing stock of the White Council for a decade at the least! Finally, with the passage of time, the book faded into obscurity, and I foolishly believed that was the last of it. Now you have the gall to come here and suggest to me that the book might contain knowledge of worth to the Lore-masters of Eriador? Bah! Some days, I wonder if the lot of you combined have the sense of a stone-headed dwarf! As for the missing pages, if you are so keen to know how the story ends, then I suggest you go find them yourself -- you will get no help from me I assure you! Now be off!'",
