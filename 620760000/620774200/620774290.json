Your tales of derring-do and battles against the forces of evil have become quite well known around these parts\\nNow if we just had a hundred or so more like you, I fancy I'd be a good sight less likely to find myself roasting on a troll's spit come year's end. But alas, as there is only one of you, I suppose I'd best finish up my compositions quickly.\\nNow don't look so forlorn there - who knows? Perhaps the tales of your prowess will one day provide a measure of comfort to those who find themselves working in the slave mines of Mordor? That's a happy thought, no?'",
