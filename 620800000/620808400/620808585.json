Hollin of old was full of life, but now even the birds seem suspicious and hostile.\\n\\n'These hills are riddled with natural caverns, though none approach the splendour of even the unworked passages of Khazad-dûm. Unpleasant creatures have taken refuge in some of these, and I fear they will cause trouble for my people if we remain here overlong.\\n\\n'To the south-west, across the dry river-bed of the Sirannon, is the cave called Filgogân. A company of half-orcs has an encampment deep inside that place; if you care to assist the dwarves of this expedition, you will thin their numbers and defeat their leader, Graug.'",
