But I recently finished an arrow different from all the rest.\\n\\n'My friend Faengris, with whom I learned the craft of bow-making and arrow-fletching, was recently slain by a company of Orcs that came down from the Misty Mountains. When the sharp pains of grief lessened somewhat, I set to making an arrow of such bite that it could kill a marching line of Orcs with one shot when fired from a quality bow.\\n\\n'This arrow in memory of Faengris may be some small comfort to his widow, Núrelleth. Bring it to her that she may see that the Orcs will pay for his death. She can often be found on Telain Glorelloth, where the flets extend over the encircling hedge.'",
