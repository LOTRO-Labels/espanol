You may rest here from the darkness, for the Galadhrim keep it at bay.\\n\\n'This is a strange place we have landed in; the shades here are troubled. If the Necromancer had ruined this place, I do not think it would feel so disturbing. Nay, some other factor played a role in the collapse of this village. The curiosity of the Elves, however, is not raised by mortal affairs, and I am here to aid them. I cannot peer into the matter as I would wish, however.\\n\\n'You are not bound to the Golden Host, [placeholder]. Will you find out what has come to pass in this strange and troubled town? The shades stir as if roused, but they do not behave as most Oathbreakers do. I believe there is some grim history here that has been overlooked by every tale. There is a graveyard yonder -- perhaps you should begin your search there.'",
