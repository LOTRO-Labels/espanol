I say it was a curse for the periods when it thawed, setting loose those evils upon the mountains.

When you have finished Gandalf strokes his beard, deep in thought.\\n\\n'It may have been merely good fortune that caused the Herald of Winter to seal herself once more within the glacier, [placeholder], but I see another power at work. At any rate, the Dwarves of the Ered Mithrin have proven fortunate, for once; they need not worry about Hrímil Frost-heart on this day, although a day may come when they must.\\n\\n'I do not believe Karazgar was truly slain, however. It may be that the Herald of Winter has given the Weeping Warrior his fill of battle, for now, but I have heard whispers from the dwarves of this place that a trail of blood and rust led away from Hrímil's chamber. I am certain Karazgar lives.\\n\\n'Scouts here at Skarháld might have seen some sign of him. Mudro is to the north-east, on the upper level, and may know of Karazgar's escape.
