This is the information we withheld from the rest of the company, [placeholder]: Balakhâd still lives. He was freed from the prison of the Ordâkhai by a mysterious stranger wielding dark sorcery. This stranger ripped the very life from the guards, leaving clear a path for Balakhâd to flee.\\n\\n'You know this power, for it is the same sorcery Azagath used upon the members of Belondor's crew beneath the Mâkhda Khorbo. He must have learned that Balakhâd was taken by the Ordâkhai and came to rescue him for some purpose of his own.\\n\\n'The guards I overheard had no desire to pursue their fleeing captive; they feared for their lives. They said he escaped to the tombs of Nirgambâr, north-west of Jirush, and believed he would die there; the tombs have an evil reputation. We did not remain behind to go to Shonith, [placeholder]. We go to Nirgambâr to search for the last remaining Heir of Castamir. He would not have chosen the most grand of the tombs, but may have hidden himself in one of the less important burial chambers. Search for such an entrance there and defeat the wights that stalk in Nirgambâr, and we may locate this missing Heir of Castamir.'",
