You see, while you were out trying to retrieve my pages, I decided to give it a try myself. Unfortunately, while I was travelling along the banks of the river to the south-west, I came face-to-face with the biggest kalpa-kita I have yet seen here -- and he looked hungry!\\n\\n'Well, to make a long story short, you know how they say that music soothes the savage beast? Ha! Do not wager your life on it! That horrid cat barely let me get out the first verse before he ripped the strings right out of my prized lute! I was so angry I could have bashed him senseless with my lute right then and there -- but then I would need a new lute and not just a new set of strings, so I ran instead.\\n\\n'As for the strings, I have just the thing -- could you find that sabre-tooth and drag his sorry carcass back to me? I have never used cat-gut strings before, but I think now is the perfect time to give them a try! The Lossoth here say they have hunted this cat before without much luck -- they call him Laulu-vihâja...he supposedly has a den on that island in the Lune.'",
