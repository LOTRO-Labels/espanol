Stranger still, it seems his Orcs have some sort of alliance with Ungwetári....\\n\\n'I would ask that you take the Silent One's armour and sneak into Cirith Ungol. Perhaps what you learn there may lead us to Shelob or uncover some terrible plan for the armies of King Elessar. If the words of my father are to be trusted, Ungwetári... this Shelob, is beyond the skill of you or I alone. However, if she is found, we may prepare to move against her and ready our defences should she wander from the Ephel Dúath.\\n\\n'It is fortunate, indeed, that the Silent One could not speak. If Frodo and Sam fooled them, I have no fear that you will do the same! \\n\\n'[placeholder], I ask that you only return to me when you are able. I do not want them to become suspicious of you!\\n\\n'I shall keep watch from afar, and attempt to aid you if your disguise fails.'",
