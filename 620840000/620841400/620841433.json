His was a weakened state in Buzun-gh√¢r, but if he is able to return and remain undetected for too long a time....\\n\\n'Let us hope that does not happen. The few scrolls that refer to Grawulun refer to him in the plural. I hope that is merely an error, and not a troubling reference to Grawulun's full strength.\\n\\n'The more quickly we discover Grawulun's return, if indeed he does, the better for us all. His return could have terrible consequences.'",
