With the creature now dead, either from exhaustion or at his master's hand, our ability to track the Nazgûl is lessened.\\n\\n'Lessened but not gone, perhaps. I would ask you to return to Imladris and to consult with Lord Glorfindel, for he is accounted very wise and may have some strategem we have not yet tested.
