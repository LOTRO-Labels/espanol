I understand that the Corsair Jajax considers you a friend, or at least... not an enemy? If that is so, you should see if he will join the crew and bring to this mission his knowledge and experience. If you can trust him, that is.\\n\\nJajax was last seen in Dol Amroth, I understand? You should speak with Prince Imrahil in the Palace of the Swan, in King's Gondor West, to learn if his guards know where Jajax went after you met with him. Jajax did not know what happened to his brother after they escaped from Umbar, but he has likely gone in search of him, if Daxamat still lives.",
