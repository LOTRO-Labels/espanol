This panel shows you all of the emotes available to your character, including both emotes that you already have and emotes you have yet to earn. You can use the selection boxes on the left side of the panel to filter which emotes you see. For example, clicking 'Have' will only show you emotes that you already have. Selecting an individual emote will show you what your character will look like when performing the emote and show you how to acquire it. You may drag an individual emote onto your Quickslot bar and execute the emote from there.",
