However, I believe I see something of myself in him. Spall is a curious dwarf and he is well-learned in the history of the dwarves. Indeed, Spall might prove invaluable to this expedition. I was hesitant to allow him to begin his survey unaccompanied, but with you here, I see no reason to keep him from his studies!\\n\\n'Besides, I need your help with another matter, my friend. After we established camp here at Watchers' Roost, I sent two companies to investigate some of the old passages of Gloomingtarn. One of my warriors, Vithin, led his company to Glittengrof, and another, Lokur, led his to Ormgren. My scouts spied a few glass-spiders near the entrance to Glittengrof, but I know little of Ormgren. Unfortunately, neither company has returned or even sent word—be it good or ill. Needless to say, I have become concerned. Either they have made some great discovery, or some terrible fate may have befallen them. If you find them in the course of Spall's survey, aid them as best you can. I would not leave any of my warriors behind!\\n\\n'Go, [placeholder], and tell Spall that he may begin his survey in Glittengrof and Ormgren—so long as you accompany him!'",
