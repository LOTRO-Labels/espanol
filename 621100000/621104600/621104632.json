We would make funny animals: ducks, and rabbits, and chickens. Oh, and the stories we would tell! The adventures those rabbits and ducks had! Such stories. Those days have long passed, but when I close my eyes I can still see those shadows; dancing, vaulting, gamboling. I still hear their peals of laughter.\\n\\n'When my husband came home, I would first see him by the shadow he cast on the wall. So broad and powerful, that shadow was the harbinger of my precious Eshtali coming home to me. Just like my sisters, I sought comfort in that shadow, always steady, strangely solid.\\n\\n'After he was taken, I am ashamed to say I forgot what his face looked like, once so familiar to me. I can no longer see his face. All I see of him now is that shadow on the wall, insubstantial like a wraith, endlessly dancing through my memories.'",
