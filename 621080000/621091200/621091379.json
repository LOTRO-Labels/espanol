I am worried something has happened to him with all these Corsairs about as he is never too careful when he should be.\\n\\n'It may all be for nothing... and mayhap he stopped at \\qThe Brew and Bounty\\q and lost track of the day... but please go and check for me, you can find the tavern if you take the northern lift down and go up the stairs behind it. Send him back home when you find him. You can mark him by his brown hair and azure tunic he wears.'",
