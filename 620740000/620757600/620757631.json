      "en": "To the Mayor, Will Whitfoot, of Michel Delving,\\n\\nI am writing to you from the town of Archet, Mayor, and I have some outrageous news to report. Before you arrived in office, many members of my family had been comfortable with travelling throughout the Shire -- indeed, even into Bree-land, on occasion! -- and felt no fear of danger to their persons or effects. Now that you are in office, Mayor, the situation is much different! I have been put in the way of harm at the hands of unsavoury Big Folk, and I am holding you personally accountable, Whitfoot!\\n\\nYou will pay just compensation for the damage to my peace of mind and the loss of comfort this experience has caused me, and you will do so at once!\\n\\nI direct you to make this payment to my aunt Lobelia at Bag End -- she will hold it for me until I have settled my senses enough and feel ready to make the trip to Hobbiton. You had better do this, Whitfoot, or you can say good-bye to your position as Mayor.\\n\\nMundo Sackville-Baggins, Concerned Citizen",
