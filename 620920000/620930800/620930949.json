He always had such an air of mystery about him, which is saying something since the only air most hobbits have about them is one of pipe-weed and their last meal.\\n\\n'Bilbo was refreshing he was - shook us all up some and that's a good thing, no doubt.  We need some rousing out of our usual routine!  Not all of us have the constitution to be explorers, so it's a precious commodity indeed when we get a hobbit with real stories to tell.\\n\\n'Anyhow, I hear that Bilbo was getting bored, and can you blame him?  So when Gandalf was setting off his lovely fireworks, Bilbo grabbed onto one and off he went!  Soared off into the skies in a trail of sparks!  Now shake your head if you like, but I think that Bilbo Baggins could do just nearly anything he put his mind to, and I'm not changing my story!\\n\\n'Oh, I'd love to know where he landed and what mischief he's gotten up to since then.  I surely do hope he returns home again or I might just explode in a starburst myself from curiosity!'",
