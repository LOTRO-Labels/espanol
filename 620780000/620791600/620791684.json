A few nights ago, I was taking in the air around the northern wall of Ost Forod, and I thought I saw something gleaming in the moonlight. I wandered towards it, foolishly, so foolishly, but I was curious as to what it might be. Before too long, I had strayed beneath the eaves of the forest and had become quite turned around.\\n\\n'Suddenly, I heard a snarl from my left! As I spun to face the sound, I saw only a splash of bright white fur, matted with blood and mud. I ran, and the great brute pursued me! It sprang towards me with a great leap; I felt its hot breath steaming in the cool night air! And then -- lights! Lights from Ost Forod! Basil Gummidge had come with a party and lanterns to the outskirts, and on seeing them, the Warg gave up its pursuit!\\n\\n'Those beasts are dangerous, [placeholder], and something must be done. Not everyone will have the benefit of a fortuitous encounter with our arbiter, you know. If you're up to it, I'd ask you to defeat some of the ferocious white Wargs. You'll find them all throughout Tyrn Fornech, but especially at the Duskencleft, north of Ost Forod.'",
