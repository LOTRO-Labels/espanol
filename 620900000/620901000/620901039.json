      "en": "'Alas, [placeholder], you have no doubt learned that we are facing a siege by Orcs from the Misty Mountains. Théoden King has decreed a ban on the hunting of Orcs in Rohan, which my husband's father is rightly hesitant to break.\\n\\n'Nevertheless, Ingmar, my husband, desires to earn glory in battle and counsels his father to defend our lands by allowing him to lead an assault on the Orcs. I fear that if he does this thing, he will not return, and I will be left a widow, only newly married.\\n\\n'Ingmar's grandmother is Reeve Ingbert's chief counselor and speaks wisdom on behalf of Théoden King's decree. Perhaps if you speak with her, she can help to convince the Reeve of the wisdom of preparing our defences here at Eaworth, rather than send my husband to meet the enemy on the open field. Will you do this?'",
