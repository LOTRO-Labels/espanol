If I believed most of the Corsairs' martial forces had perished at Pelargir, it seems that the Kindred of the Coins has rebuilt them enough to man the Fleet-fast, at least, very effectively. A frontal assault upon the Citadel of Winds is, in my opinion, out of the question.\\n\\n'I could not utilize Rossaran effectively in the Fleet-fast, so I sent him to conduct his investigation within the Lower Ward.

I cannot say that what I have discovered will be of use to us, but I was able to learn how the people feel about some of the various leaders among the Kindred of the Coins.\\n\\n'Azagath and Belondor are both well-loved by the people, who give them a large portion of the credit for the Sea-stone Mutiny. That is the name given to the overthrow of the Heirs of Castamir and the Church of the All Seeing, when the oppressors of the Empire of Ordâkh were cast out of the city.\\n\\n'Hármelak, the Golden Queen, is respected more than she is loved. She is one of the wealthiest people in Umbar, but the folk of the Lower Ward distrust her riches; many of them believe she is indifferent to their plight, and would not spend a single coin on their behalf.\\n\\n'Rothog the Storm is considered a champion of the Lower Ward, for no one lives there who has not heard of his exploits in the arena, or of the manner with which he dispatched many of the Heirs of Castamir during the Mutiny. They love him... but they fear him as well.\\n\\n'Of the others I was not able to learn very much.
