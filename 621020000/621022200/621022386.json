And is it not true that Frodo's quest proved successful, and the Ring and the Dark Lord both defeated at one stroke? Indirect opposition found success where direct opposition could not, and in that I may say the Bright Company came at last to have its greatest triumph.\\n\\n'But I remember now that which I did not before.

For if he remembered the cruel tortures he suffered at the hands of Sauron, how could he oppose the Dark Lord upon his return, knowing the extent of Sauron's malice?\\n\\n'And so we chose not to speak of Lendelen or his sad fate within the Dark Tower during the final days of the Second Age. I did not wish to inflict this harm upon Ol贸rin, Mithrandir, or Gandalf... and for that I beg his forgiveness. Lendelen was my closest advisor, my dearest friend, and I failed him. I thought it best to leave his memory behind, for if that was the purpose of the Valar I would not wish to do otherwise.'",
