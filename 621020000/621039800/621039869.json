She lifts the square-shaped stone, exposing a hollow space, and stops humming. Inside rests an unassuming bundle of elk-hide, worn with age. Salavahti takes the bundle and unwraps it, revealing an intricately detailed metal key. You see that the key is quite large, and the seven-pointed star of Arnor serves as its handle. This must be the key of Agoroth. Salavahti holds the key toward you, allowing you to take it.\\n\\n'Our business is concluded, outsider. May you do great things with this.

What do you want from Yrjänä?'\\n\\nYou explain that the Angmarim are searching for a treasure in the hidden fortress of Agoroth, and that you need the key Arvedui left with the Lossoth before his death if there is any hope of beating them to it.\\n\\n'Yrjänä knows of what you speak. The Lumi-väki have kept this heirloom safe. But I ask, do you know the true significance of this item? It is more than a metal key to a metal door. The Lumi-väki know. My people have long memories.\\n\\n'The songs tell of a time long ago, when the tall men came in suits of iron. They asked the Lumi-väki for peace, and to swear an oath before a great stone, blue as the sky on a clear day. The Lumi-väki swore to help the tall men fight their enemies, and in trade, we received weapons of forged metal to fight our ancient rivals, the Gauredain. A good trade, until the Iron Men went to war. Many Lumi-väki died in foreign lands, facing enemies that were not our own.\\n\\n'Even still, the Lumi-väki kept our oath and the peace with the Iron Men and their descendants. One day, they came again to Sûri-kylä. They said the stone must be moved and hidden. There were other stones, with oaths made by other clans, that were taken, and corrupted. The Iron Men wished to build a new Stone-home here, in our lands. The Lumi-väki were hesitant. An enemy capable of corrupting such powerful magic is not an enemy to be made lightly. We knew who that enemy must be....\\n\\n'But the Lumi-väki were compelled by their oath, and allowed the Iron Men to build their Stone-home here. We hid the way with our magic, for we knew if the stone was found and corrupted, the Lumi-väki would become bound to that evil.\\n\\n'For many years, the Iron Men were left to their Stone-home. Rarely, one would come to Sûri-kylä to barter for supplies. Then came a foul wind carrying the scent of evil, followed by the worst storm in many generations. No more Iron Men came after that day, and we feared the stone must now be unprotected.\\n\\n'This key... it will unlock the door to the Oath-stone. Of this Yrjänä is certain. It will be given in trade, but not for goods or currency, no... in return, Yrjänä asks that [placeholder] makes #-1:{her[f]|his} own oath. Promise to the Lumi-väki that you will protect the stone from Angmar, and promise Yrjänä that you will find a way to destroy the Oath-stone for good. The Lumi-väki wish to be be bound to no-one. We will give our allegiance to those deserving, and fight enemies we understand fully.\\n\\n'Do you accept?'",
