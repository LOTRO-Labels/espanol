We have worked tirelessly for quite some time, and sadly, I must admit that with all of my knowledge I am left with as many questions as I have answers.'\\n\\nFaranil looks at the pot where the sapling grows.\\n\\n'We know that the sapling is native here to the Ettenmoors and that the land itself is helping it become strong. I am still loath to bring soil from elsewhere to nurture the sapling because I do not know enough. But I am limited in my knowledge and I think it is time to reach beyond these lands into the halls of my home at Rivendell.\\n\\n'Elrond knows much of our history and stores more of it within the libraries of the Last Homely House. Please, take your tale to him and learn what he might know and then return to me.'",

A sapling that stirs at your passage is a thing of which I have not heard since the Great Forest covered nearly all of Middle-earth. It is a rare thing these days.

Perhaps the land is healing, though the battle still persists. Go with that knowledge, and the hope that the tomorrow you make for the sapling you have found will be one of bright light.'",
