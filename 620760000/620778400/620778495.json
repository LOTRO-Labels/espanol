I'll give you a coin or two if you help me out, but I don't know how many more times I can pretend to be surprised that Daisy is hiding in the bushes next to Peony Grubb's home, or that Polo is crouched behind the carved statue of Marcho and Blanco.\\n\\n'You'll find the statue carved on a large tree stump just south of here, and I'm sure that Polo Brockhouse is hiding right by it. South-east of the statue, there's a small hill with several hobbit-houses behind a wooden fence -- Daisy thinks the bushes to the right of Peony Grubb's house are a clever place to hide. Find my friends for me, and next time I'll try and tell them I don't feel like playing Hiders and Seekers!'",
