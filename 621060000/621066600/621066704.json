Were our errand here not so urgent, there would be more time to spare for your training, but here is a word of advice:\\n\\n'Unlike the brash Champion, a Captain does not best serve his companions by running recklessly into the fray. Nay, it is the Captain who stands behind and dutifully guides the efforts of his fellows that wins the day! Even so, the time may come when you must take up arms and wade into battle yourselfâ€”and that is no time to show weakness. With careful technique and precision, a Captain might land a Devastating Blow against even the mightiest foe!\\n\\n'Show me your skill and deliver a <rgb=#00ff00>Devastating Blow</rgb> to one of these training dummies. Do not hold back!'\\n\\nHINT:\\n\\nCaptains rely on their <rgb=#00ff00>Battle Shout</rgb> to put them into a <rgb=#ffff00>Battle-Readied State</rgb>. While in this state, Captains can use special skills such as <rgb=#00ff00>Devastating Blow</rgb>, an effective attack that deals a great deal of damage.
