There's something terrible happening in the Shire, and you need to do something about it before it's too late!\\n\\n'I was walking on the Greenfields, looking for flowers, when I saw a squat, little man off in the distance. He was carrying a spear, and believe me when I tell you that he was a goblin! All of a sudden he dropped to the ground, and it looked to me like he was reaching into a hole of some kind... a rabbit hole most likely. I was so scared I ran back here and told my brother what I saw, but I don't think he believed me.\\n\\n'The Greenfields are out north-west of here. Maybe you ought go look in those rabbit holes yourself. Don't know what it was looking for, but it can't be good for the Shire!'",

A long, long time ago, the goblin-king Golfimbul tried to invade the Shire, but he was defeated by Bandobras Took, the mighty Bullroarer! In one swing, Bullroarer knocked off Golfimbul's head... and it went flying through the air and landed in a rabbit hole.\\n\\n'Golfimbul is back, and he's searching all the rabbit holes on the Greenfields for his missing head!
