I do not know you, nor your needs. But there is honest work to be had in Mossward. Prey upon those who travel this road at your own peril.'\\nThe thief sneered.\\n'I will not be bossed around by the likes of you!'\\nThe thief went to draw his dagger, but the Ranger, as he would one day come to know her as, was upon him in an instant. She parried his feeble stab and disarmed him, sending the blade clattering to the ground. The thief felt the bite of cold steel against his neck, and he froze.\\n'The only reason I am giving you this chance is that you did not harm the woman from whom you stole.'\\nShe withdrew her blade, and the thief's hands snapped to his neck, checking for blood. He found none. By the time he recovered himself, the Ranger's back was to him. She was walking away.\\nHe looked to where his dagger had fallen, then to the Ranger, and decided to do the same.",
