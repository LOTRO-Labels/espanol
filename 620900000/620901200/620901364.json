It is called Minas Morgul now, and those of us who remember what it once stood for are few. Many of my fellows abandoned the cause, because it seemed impossible to go on. They said we toiled for naught.\\n\\n'Would they think so if they could stand where I stand now and gaze upon these likenesses of Isildur and Anárion? They are a reminder, [placeholder], that the works of Men will last, that the spirit of Man cannot be crushed, despite adversity and the passage of time. Even the Orcs cannot tear them down, and if they sought to, my heart sings that Men would take the pieces and build them anew.'",
