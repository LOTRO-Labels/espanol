Nay, my hunt was for the foes of my people: the Orc and the Uruk!\\n\\n'In the woods I found two such creatures discussing a recent battle. I thought they spoke of the Orc-ambush that troubled this very camp, but then they spoke of a mighty hero that cut down dozens of their number. At that moment, I leaped from the concealing bushes and slew them, shouting \\qTo your sorrow he returns!\\q\\n\\n'Afterwards, I decided they probably spoke not of me, but of another. There is another glade to the far south-east of here, at a narrow place between the cliffs and the great lake. That might be the one of which they spoke. Go there and see what there is to see! I want to know what happened to this hero mightier even than Wilferth!'",
