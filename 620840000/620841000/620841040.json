We have few warriors to spare with the strength of our forces heading towards Gathbúrz and Dol Guldur...your aid is most appreciated.\\n\\n'Can you make out those Orkish fortresses down below? They call them Krul Lugu in their Black Speech. Krul Lugu marks the southern flank of our advance, and I am tasked with ensuring that they are unable to mount a strike against us at Ost Galadh. The Orcs are cut off from the bulk of their forces in Dol Guldur, so their numbers are not great...but ours are spread even more thinly here, so we are trying to keep their attention occupied rather than risk a large-scale battle. To that end, we strive to demoralize and blind them, keeping them in place and paralyzed with uncertainty.\\n\\n'I have a simple task for you: Destroy their war-banners. It is naught but a symbolic effort, but as they appear to be bereft of strong leadership, it should be sufficient to set them back before they can rebuild their courage.'",
