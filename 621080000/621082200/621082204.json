I abandoned my kingdom, my friends, and the woman I love, and I thought it was for their own good. I punished myself for the weakness I saw in myself, and I believed my wife and kingdom would be better off without relying on such a man as I am. Horn perished on the Pelennor, and Driftwood was born. But that death, and that birth... they changed nothing. I told myself it was right, but it was not.\\n\\n'I am done with being alone. I think once our mission is concluded... I might be brave enough to see Nona again. Will you go with me when that time comes?'\\n\\nYou tell your friend that you will, and he smiles grimly.\\n\\n'I do not think she will be happy to see me, [placeholder]. I may need you to convince me to go through with such a meeting, if my courage fails me. But for now I intend it.'",
