During the Second Age, a vengeful Lord Br√∫ni led a campaign against the trolls, earning himself the title of Trollbane. The dwarves slaughtered the trolls of the region and drove the survivors into the Ettenmoors. Despite this, trolls have returned to Elderslade and now endanger efforts to retake Gundabad.",
