I do not trust him, but more so: I feel in my heart he will see first to the defence of Cliving and not leave his walls to protect the rest of us. The other towns of the Norcrofts do not have Cliving's natural defences.\\n\\n'You have been a good help to me, but I know you are eager to progress westward in pursuit of the Uruks you seek. Go south-west to Faldham by way of the river crossing, to scout and see if the crossing is held by foes. Also, I ask that you collect emblems from any Orcs you find in the Norcrofts. Show those emblems to Elfhelm, the Thane of Faldham, as proof that we must stand on our own and not rely on Athelward.\\n\\n'Oh, wait! Elfhelm has gone to the Fords of Isen. His son, Elfmar, must have rule of Faldham in his absence. Show him the emblems.'",
