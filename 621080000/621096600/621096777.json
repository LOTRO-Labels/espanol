Now several of their family members have come to us, asking us to locate them, as it's been several days since they've been seen. We had hoped to send several warriors, but the Ordâkhai demand our full attention. Can you investigate this claim? It's probably just a twisted ankle that is slowing their return, but we cannot rule out something more dangerous.\\n\\n'Please, go to Zahûmakh and search for these travellers or clues to their whereabouts. It would be a great kindness to their families for any news.'",
