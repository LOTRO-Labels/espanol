He puts the ingredients in a large cooking pot and places it in the oven. As it simmers, the smell is enticing and it starts to feel like it's been forever since you last ate.\\n\\nEndunâm finally takes the pot from the oven, inspects his handiwork, and gives it a taste.\\n\\n'Mmm. Quite good, but not exactly the same. I am getting closer though!  Here, have a bowl and I will give you some to take on the road. Thank you for your help lûkal, be safe in your travels!'",

They grow on vines to the north-east along the road to the old salt mines. I will need loins from fen-wallowers. There are many of them far to the east in Shegdush. You can also find fresh herbs that I think will be perfect for this dish in Shegdush. The sooner you get them, the sooner we can eat!'",
