Remember that there is much to be gained from starting a fight behind your enemy, and you can do so by sneaking your way to a good position. From there, a cunning attack will ensure that the battle begins on your terms.\\n\\nNow, when it comes down to a proper brawl, let me tell you...there are no rules. Be sure to use tricks to unbalance your foe. Tricks are a Burglar's greatest talent. They are not fair, but they get the job done. Do not forget to marvel at your handywork a bit, though. Some mischievous glee after a good trick will refocus your enemy, but leave you feeling much better for it.\\n\\nFight well, fight a bit dirty, and do not lose your marbles!\\n\\n- T.",
