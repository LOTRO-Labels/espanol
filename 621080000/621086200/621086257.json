We come to the Fathomwell every morning, and some days he catches more fish than I do, and sometimes I have better luck than he, and often we send a helpful stranger back and forth across the pool to inquire about the other's fortunes. There really is no end to it... at least until the sun goes down, and then we each go back to our homes and it all starts again the next day.\\n\\n'I suppose I would miss it.

My favourites were always the ones with fighting, like when bloodthirsty Thorongil attacked and set the city aflame. Did you know not even the waters of Fathomwell could put out the fires? They burned for days, my father said.\\n\\n'Tarax loved those stories too. I had forgotten! We used to fish on the same side of the pool, but at some point we became so competitive that we could not do that any longer.
