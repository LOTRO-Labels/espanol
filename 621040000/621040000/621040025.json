      "en": "Creaky weather today in the Bridges. Still angry about my missed chance. I've lived over the pit my whole life, but does that matter to anyone? Does that matter to Gorgar? No, it don't. He could have chosen me, Shakgog, and maybe then I'd have the life I deserve! Well, he'll regret it, somehow. Somehow!\\n\\nWeather settled down a bit. I had a good spot near the fire today, but a great oaf kicked me in the side and I had to leave it in a hurry. Later I saw him cleaning his teeth with one of the finger-bones I found in that bug nest. That was mine!\\n\\nCreaky weather's back, worse than usual. Saw the oaf again today. Trying to think of a way to kill him without anyone knowing. If Gorgar picked me I could do it easily! Still angry. Have to be careful someone don't get me first.",
