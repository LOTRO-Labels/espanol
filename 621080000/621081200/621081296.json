Did he know where these could be found, and was able to retrieve them quickly and easily?\\n\\n'Ah, nevermind. I know Yared and the other dwarves who work for me think I disapprove of their games, but I would not make them stop playing them. I know how important such things are for the smooth running of the fortress! What matters is that when work comes in, it is accomplished without hesitation or delay... and here it has been.\\n\\n'But do not tell Yared what I have said to you! Let him and the others think they are getting away with something. If fear that I might take away their Stacking Game keeps them sharp, who am I to dull them by letting slip that it is fine? If that must be the relationship between worker and supervisor, so be it.'\\n\\nShegai hums a brief tune, and then laughs.\\n\\n'If I were not their supervisor, however, and was invited to play, I tell you I would stack my crates the highest! I was very skilled at such things when I was young.'",
