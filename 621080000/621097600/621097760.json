Our coup was successful, but it did not lead to Khârdu's rise and orders to abandon these lands and return south to our homes as he intended. Another ambitious lord usurped the former's place, displaced my captain to a position in the east, and kept the men most loyal to Khârdu close at hand. I am embedded with the bastard Jombahok now.\\n\\nI paid the courier delivering this message a month's rations and coin to see it safely delivered to you. I yearn to return to your embrace, feel your tender touch, and see the bright smile on our child's face.\\n\\nI am duty-bound to remain here in Khûd Zagin until our campaign is done. If I try to run, the lash will be my reward before they quarter me and send my remains as a warning. I am trapped in this hell, my love. If you will it and send me word that you want me to take this risk, I will.\\n\\nUntil then, I remain ever yours,\\n\\nBosóta ",
