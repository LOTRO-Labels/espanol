I know not the precise reason for which Sauron imprisoned him, though I might make a guess. The chains that bind him within this statue remain unbroken; the Dark Lord must have drawn upon another source to fashion those bonds. They survived his own defeat, to the sorrow of Megorlam.\\n\\n'My struggle with the captive spirit has revealed this much, Taurdir: he possessed knowledge of some secret that even Sauron knew not. He taunted the Dark Lord with this secret, claiming that this power was beyond Sauron, impossible for even that terrible sorcerer to harness. \\qThis power is beyond all living memory!\\q he said to Sauron, and great was the Dark Lord's anger. As I strove against Megorlam, he repeated these three words over and over again: \\qbeyond living memory,\\q he cried, \\qbeyond living memory!\\q\\n\\n'I believe Megorlam thought to ensnare me with the promise of knowledge, attempting to steal my powers and use them to break from his prison. I proved more capable than he expected, Taurdir, and he has relented in that effort, but I dare not speak to him again lest he overcome my defences.\\n\\n'But his words trouble me, my Ranger friend. A power beyond Sauron...'",
