This was Imlad Ithil, and nowhere else in Gondor could rival its beauty when the Ithilduin river sparkled in the moonlight like a vein of silver threaded between dark cliffs. When Isildur came to these shores with his father and brother, he was so taken by the beauty of this valley that he built a citadel beneath the slopes of Achathras, tallest peak of the Ephel Dúath. Minas Ithil he called it, and Barad Cúron, the Tower of the Crescent Moon, rose from its topmost level.\\n\\n'But that was long ago, and the Lord of the Nazgûl coveted the valley and the citadel sheltered within. Twice the Witch-king seized the city. The first time, he possessed it only until the Last Alliance of Men and Elves came south and fought the war that ended the Second Age. Minas Ithil remained under the control of Gondor for centuries, and although it would never again attain the heights it had known under Isildur, it drew the imaginations of poets, artists, and minstrels from all over the kingdom.\\n\\n'That all came to a sad end with the second of the Witch-king's assaults upon the city. When the Nazgûl captured Minas Ithil for the second time, that name could no longer describe the citadel. It became Minas Morgul, the Tower of Sorcery, and so it would stay.'",
