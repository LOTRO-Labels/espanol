We brought what we could carry up the Straight Stair, but it will not last long. Going forward, we must choose between finding a source of sustenance here among the darkness and corruption, or send someone to fetch more rations from Captain Faramir's camp, and that is a treacherous journey. Obviously, the former is preferable.\\n\\n'I have seen some deer and goats while scouting the area. Would you please hunt some of them, so I can assess if the meat is edible?'",
