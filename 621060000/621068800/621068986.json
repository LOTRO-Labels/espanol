How many bounties am I cursed to lose because of your interference? \\qMaster Good-heart?\\q Do you mean Geralt Goodblossom, noted ruffian?'\\n\\nYou tell Melona that Geralt is a very common name, possessed by many folk in the south, and it is surely a coincidence. She shakes her head.\\n\\n'I have been hunting Geralt and Eilian Goodblossom for several days now, but thanks to the injury I sustained in Sedgemead I have been always a step behind. While I hunted them, they hunted targets of their own: the Redclaw brothers, three powerful brigands who together directed much of the villainy present in these lands. Now that the three Redclaws are no more, the Goodblossoms are free to enact the next step of their plan: seizing control! They do not wish to free these lands of brigand control... husband and wife wish to consolidate it beneath their own leadership!'\\n\\nYou tell Melona that you have met both Eilian and Geralt, and would be willing to help her track them down.\\n\\n'No! I mean... no thank you, [placeholder]. It's just that I think you might be bad luck. I have only had ill fortune ever since you stumbled upon me in Sedgemead, and I fear it may get worse.
