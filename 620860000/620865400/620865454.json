As many folk in these parts know, Old Mad Baggins was a great lover of riddles, so it seems he left a riddle or two for us in his Haunted Burrow.\\n\\n'Only problem is, I can't make a thing of it! After the first riddle, I must have had a drink from the wrong bottle, and it made me worse off than before.\\n\\n'I believe he meant for us to have a great treasure if we managed to solve it all, but who has the patience for such tomfoolery? If you can figure it out and tell me how it goes, I'll be sure to give you all the coins I've managed to get my hands on so far.'\\n\\n<rgb=#FF0000>NOTE: Only one Haunted Burrow quest may be underway at a time.</rgb>",
