Can it be that Vóin wrote these secret words in the light of that beacon, knowing they could only be revealed by the same light? But what did he seek to hide? Did he record the location of the weapon sought by Gothmog?\\n\\n'We must read the secret writing in the Black Book, [placeholder]. Let me know if you are ready to do so.'",

When the sword Dúnachar pierced Mordirith's form in the throne room of Carn Dûm, the purpose of the Witch-king was fulfilled, a thousand years later, but not in the manner for which he planned. Bonds were made that day, and months later, on the Pelennor Fields before Minas Tirith, they would be broken. He could not remember it, but one thousand years later, Eärnur's final act of resistance freed him from the domination of Mordor.'\\n\\nGandalf closes the Black Book and looks up at you.\\n\\n'That is enough for now, my friend. We have come to the end of the moon-writing, but the discovery has stirred in me the certainty that I missed something in my earlier perusal of this tome. I do not know what it may have been, but I can sense its presence still.\\n\\n'Ah, mysteries upon mysteries. Perhaps I will return to this matter when we have satisfied our other charge. Yes, I fear we have spent too many hours in study and neglected our other tasks.'",
