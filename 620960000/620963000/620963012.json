Many of my workers have traded the cisterns for the wall and now work to defend the city. Do you blame them?\\n\\n'On my weekly inspection of the cisterns I've come to find this main drainage valve here completely broken. It was in perfect order just last week! I highly suspect sabotage, but who in the city would do such a thing?\\n\\n'I could use your help as various parts of the valve are missing and I think they may be somewhere in the cisterns. It is a vast cavernous series of tunnels, and a good place to hide something. If I don't fix this valve soon, the lower cisterns could flood!'",
