That goes far back...hoom, far back indeed.\\n\\n'Let me see, I believe it was some years after the Men of the Sea and the Elves drove back the old darkness again, and not so long after the Gardens of the Entwives were laid waste, that an old, dark-hearted spider wove her lair not far from here, in the darkest part of old Fangorn. There she waited, preying upon any so unfortunate as to wander in among her maze of webs.\\n\\n'Of course, in those days, there were few who came here, for the forest had been roused to great anger after the desolation of the Gardens, and many of those who had once lived near the forest had died in the war or been driven away, so there was little prey for one such as she. I believe she grew ever more ravenous, and in time, we discovered that she had even tried to slake her endless hunger with the living sap of the trees, and so, ta-rum, we turned our anger upon her and her brood.\\n\\n'We drove her out then, brushing aside her webs as a child brushes aside cobwebs, and hounded her until she fled beneath the roots of the Misty Mountains. Hoom-hom! We never heard her name again...what was it? Let me think. Hoom! Gurth√∫l? Yes, I think that was it.\\n\\n'Do spiders live so long? I would not think so, but then, I am not a spider, so I cannot say. She would not return here though. She is not strong enough to fight us, and her webs are no hindrance to an Ent, for we can crush stone if we are so inclined. But still, Greylimb is ill from a spider's venom, and the trees around us sicken....'",

The samples you brought from the larger varieties of spider are dangerous, certainly, but I do not think they would harm an Ent. The Onodrim are quite resistant to such things. But this glowing venom...you say it came from a much smaller variety of spider? It is the most potent I have seen. It is very likely the same venom that has afflicted poor Greylimb. Fortunately, with a pure sample available, I should be able to brew a draught that may help purge the venom from him, in time.\\n\\n'But mysteries remain. How is it that a spider came to possess such a venom, seemingly meant to kill trees and Onodrim, and how did this venom find its way into the water and the roots of the trees here? If we cannot stop it soon, much of the forest along the river's edge will soon sicken and die. You may want to ask the Onodrim if they have seen these spiders lurking about at the forest's edge of late.'",
