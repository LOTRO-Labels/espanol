At sea I was given permission to walk freely about the ship, and I followed her commands quickly and well. Did my captivity chafe? I cannot say it did not, but I felt it was in service of a noble purpose, and that was enough. Tatháta suggested I be allowed to walk freely about the ships and the harbour when we docked, but the Wave-reaper feared my servility was an act, and commanded her kinswoman to keep me tied to the mast while Nakási was away. I cannot tell you with complete certainty if she was right, [placeholder].\\n\\n'But I can tell you this. The Kindred of the Coins value their captives only for so long as they retain value. Had I proven a burden or unmanageable, I think I would not have survived the voyage to Umbar. It may be the same with the young heir of Pinnath Gelin. If he loses his value as a hostage, I believe he will not long survive in the Kindred's company.\\n\\n'Nakási brought him to Azagath Sea-shadow in the Citadel of Winds, from where the Kindred rule this city.
