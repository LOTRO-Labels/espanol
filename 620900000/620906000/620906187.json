We recently noticed that the weapons of our enemies have improved in quality, leading me to believe those goblins found something in the hills. My guess is a vein of iron, something we could desperately use ourselves. We do not have the men remaining to run the mine ourselves, but it may be enough to disrupt the enemy's operations and utilize some of the work they have already done for our own gain.'",
