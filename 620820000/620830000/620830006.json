Stonetooth the Savage, a particularly vicious deepclaw, has dispatched several of our messengers and scouts. We have tried to trap him, but he always tunnels away, and now we know where to!\\n\\n'He must have been making Khibir-zamu his home the entire time and simply returning there once he found his meal for the night. Well, if we cannot catch him within the halls and tunnels of Khazad-dûm, then we shall simply have to take the fight to him.\\n\\n'Stonetooth can be found within Khibir-zamu, south-west of here. Venture within and claim vengeance upon the deep-claw that has taken so many of my friends. You may want to bring an ally or two, the Savage has bested even the greatest of dwarf-warriors.'",
