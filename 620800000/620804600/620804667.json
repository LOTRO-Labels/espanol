It has come to me that you are a warrior of some renown, and we have need of such as our battles with the Susi-väki to the west grow more frequent and deadly.\\n\\n'One of my tribe has been studying the old ruins on the northern edge of the great glacier across the Ice Bay. We believe that they were built by the dwarves, but it has lain abandoned for longer than our tales recall. I received a message from my kinsman a few days ago claiming that he had seen fell spirits clambering among the ruins. Where they might have come from he could not guess, and he dared not approach too closely for he is no warrior himself.\\n\\n'I ask you this, will you go to speak with Arre? His messages are disturbing, and in a time of war and strife, we can ill afford to ignore such an omen.'",
