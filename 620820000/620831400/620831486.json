After the dwarf was murdered, his teeth were taken and his flesh devoured. Orcs are terrible creatures, and sport with their prey. They have no dignity, no respect for the dead as we do. They would just as soon despoil their own kind in this hideous manner.\\n\\n'It is likely that the missing teeth can be found on the White Hand Orcs.
