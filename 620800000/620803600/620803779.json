The Elves learned of this and hunted Shataz down, eventually driving him up into the Misty Mountains -- but they were unable to capture or kill him.\\n\\n'Now it seems that Shataz lives up there still, and a scout discovered him once again attempting to raise a band of trolls to raid Rivendell itself from the region of Orod Laden. This is a distraction that Elrond can ill-afford at this time, and so I would have you take a small band of skilled warriors up into the Misty Mountains to do away with this troublesome creature. You should take allies with you if you plan to find this creature.'",
