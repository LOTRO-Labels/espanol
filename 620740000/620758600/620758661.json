She discovered an ancient relic lying out upon one of the ruins. We collect that which the ruins offer, as you know, and she thought nothing of consequences, as we have never seen reprisal.\\n\\n'On this day there was something different in the swamp, something stirred and frightened the girl so that she now has fits in her sleep. I fear for her, friend. Will you find Hana and speak with her to discover what visions plague her dreams?'",

She is trying to bring me to her, and that is why my sister left... to find her and stop her.\\n\\n'She is a bad person. I know she means me harm because her songs sing of blood and death. It is the nerbyg, they sing for her. I don't tell anyone, but I can hear the nerbyg singing my name even now.'",
