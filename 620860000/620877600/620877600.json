They would go there, stare down upon their city, the lake, and their ancestors and ponder the future.\\n\\n'Now, a foul presence occupies the ruins, and while they look down upon all the same things, their purpose is dark and evil. Tomb-robbers have come to fill those ruins. They are ransacking more from it each and every day.\\n\\n'The robbers must be stopped. There are not many more beyond these few here in the hills. If we draw the final line here, I believe Evendim may have a future free of them.'",
