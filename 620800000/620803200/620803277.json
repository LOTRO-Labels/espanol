I will need certain things.\\n\\n'Go to Altti the trapper at Jänis-leiri, west along the road, and ask him to loan me his sledge. I will also need rope. There should be a few extra coils at the scout-camp, out on a little island on the other side of the road, south of here. And furs, thick, soft, and warm; I do not care what kind of animal they are from. Something that will feel good on soft skin... what kind of look is that to give me? It is part of the ritual! \\n\\n'I do not have time for this; I must prepare. Go find these things for me, or get out of my sight and stay out of my way!'",
